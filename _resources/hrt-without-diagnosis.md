### How can I get hormones without a diagnosis?

Normally, your GP will want you to have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) before they are willing to prescribe. However, there are some circumstances under which your GP may be willing to prescribe without a diagnosis, and ways you can get hormones without involving your GP.

### Using a gender service outside of the UK

As well as gender services based in the UK, there are also some based outside of the UK. Some pros and cons to consider are:

In the UK, many people people looking for a service based outside of the UK use [GenderGP](https://www.gendergp.com/). 

Services based outside the UK may give you a prescription written by a doctor in the EU --- and some UK pharmacies may refuse to accept these. There is information about filling an EU prescription on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prescriptions-issued-in-the-eea-and-switzerland-guidance-for-pharmacists) and [the Royal Pharmaceutical Society website](https://www.rpharms.com/about-us/news/details/Prescriptions-issued-in-the-EEA-and-Switzerland-guidance-for-pharmacists).

### Bridging prescriptions

A bridging prescription is temporary support from your GP while you wait for a diagnosis.

{% include iconlist iconlist="bridging" %}

Waiting lists for NHS services are notoriously long, and you might be able to convince your GP that it's unreasonable to expect you to wait that long for hormones {% cite cr181 --locator 25 %}. However, current GMC guidance is for GPs to only prescribe bridging prescriptions when a patient is already self-medicating, or is likely to start self-medicating, and is at risk of self-harm or suicide {% cite GMCTransBridging %}. The guidelines also suggest that only the minimum dose is provided {% cite GMCTransBridging %}, which may result in a GP prescribing the smallest possible dose, rather than the minimum dose that is actually effective. If your GP is uncertain about providing a bridging prescription, you can suggest they speak to their local NHS gender service for advice.

You can find more information about bridging prescriptions on [the TransActual website](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions).

### Self-medicating

Self-medicating means buying hormones directly yourself.

{% include iconlist iconlist="self-med" %}

Unmonitored hormone therapy carries a number of risks. If you're already taking hormones you got from another source, your GP should strongly consider providing a bridging prescription and monitoring blood tests {% cite cr181 --locator 21 %}. You may have to convince them that without safe access to medication you will be at a greater risk of self-harm or suicide {% cite GMCTransBridging %}.

Regardless of where you get your hormones, regular blood tests are essential to make sure that your hormone levels are safe and there are no problems. You can read more about these on [our blood testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}). If your GP is unable or unwilling to give you blood tests at the practice, you should ask them to refer you to a local endocrinologist who can do the tests for them.

If you are injecting medications yourself, read [our self-injections page]({% link _resources/injections.md %}) for information about safety, getting injection supplies, and safely disposing of waste.

{%capture warn%}
Medications not bought from a legitimate pharmaceutical supplier can be dangerous or ineffective.

{%include warning warning=warn%}

Many medications sold online do not contain any active ingredients and are a waste of your money. Even if your medications are genuine, the safety and purity of the medications is not guaranteed unless you have bought them from a legitimate pharmacy.

### How do I talk to my GP?

When talking to your GP, the following references may be useful:

- The NHS England service specification {% cite specEngNonsurgical --locator 30 %} states:

  > Endocrine and other pharmacological interventions may be recommended by a registered medical practitioner in the specialist multi-disciplinary team where they are essential for the purpose of harm reduction, and where they are in the individualâ€™s best interest for reducing gender dysphoria, when assisting the individual in achieving gender expression congruent with their identity and consistent with their treatment goals.

- The NGICNS Explanatory Notes to the Scottish gender protocol {% cite ngicnsExplanatoryNotes --locator 5 %} states:

  > Some service users may already be on hormonal treatment prior to referral, either through previous prescription or self medication. It is appropriate to continue this treatment following engagement with the GIC whilst Assessment One is undertaken. Appropriate prescribing guidelines and monitoring requirements are detailed in Endocrine Management of Adult Transgender Service users (NGICNS) and all service users should be made aware of this guidance and prescribing and monitoring of treatment brought in line with this guidance.

Many GPs might be hesitant to prescribe hormones due to an unfamiliarity with the standard treatments for trans people. However, they will be familiar with the same medications used for other purposes, such as treating hypogonadism, hormone-sensitive cancers, or menopausal symptoms; the GMC {% cite GMCTransPrescribing %} notes that

> Most of the medications used for the treatment of gender dysphoria are not licensed for this specific indication, although GPs will be familiar with their use in primary care for other purposes.

A number of gender clinics have published prescribing guidelines that your GP may find useful; you can find a list of these in [the Hormones section on genderarchive.org.uk](https://genderarchive.org.uk/tag/hormones/).
