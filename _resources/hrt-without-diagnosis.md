Normally, your GP will want you to have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) before they are willing to prescribe. However, there are some circumstances under which your GP may be willing to prescribe without a diagnosis.

Vincent {% cite vincent2018transgender --locator 148 %} lists the following circumstances when it could be appropriate for your GP to prescribe hormones without referring to a GIC, or before you've been seen by the GIC you've been referred to:

- When you've *already been seen* by a GIC

  If you've already been seen by a GIC, there's little point in sending you back to one for another diagnosis.
- When you've *changed GP practice, and your previous practice was prescribing*

  There are various health risks associated with stopping hormones, so if you've already been prescribed then your GP should continue prescribing without requiring an assessment. They may want to take a blood test, and this is usually a good idea.
- When you need a *bridging prescription* --- a temporary prescription while you wait to be seen by a specialist

  Waiting lists for NHS services are notoriously long, and you might be able to convince your GP that it's unreasonable to expect you to wait that long for hormones.
- When you're already *self-medicating*, as part of a harm-reduction strategy

  Unmonitored hormone therapy carries a number of risks. If you're already taking hormones you got from another source, your GP should strongly consider providing a bridging prescription and monitoring blood tests.

It's very likely that your GP will still want to refer you to a GIC even if they do prescribe.

Regardless of where you get your hormones, regular blood tests are essential to make sure that your hormone levels are safe and there are no problems. If your GP is unable or unwilling to give you blood tests at the practice, you should ask them to refer you to a local endocrinologist who can do the tests for them.

When talking to your GP, the following references may be useful:

- The NHS England service specification {% cite specEngNonsurgical --locator 30 %} states:

  > Endocrine and other pharmacological interventions may be recommended by a registered medical practitioner in the specialist multi-disciplinary team where they are essential for the purpose of harm reduction, and where they are in the individualâ€™s best interest for reducing gender dysphoria, when assisting the individual in achieving gender expression congruent with their identity and consistent with their treatment goals.

- The NGICNS Explanatory Notes to the Scottish gender protocol {% cite ngicnsExplanatoryNotes --locator 5 %} states:

> Some service users may already be on hormonal treatment prior to referral, either through previous prescription or self medication. It is appropriate to continue this treatment following engagement with the GIC whilst Assessment One is undertaken. Appropriate prescribing guidelines and monitoring requirements are detailed in Endocrine Management of Adult Transgender Service users (NGICNS) and all service users should be made aware of this guidance and prescribing and monitoring of treatment brought in line with this guidance.

Many GPs might be hesitant to prescribe hormones due to an unfamiliarity with the standard treatments for trans people. However, a number of gender clinics have published prescribing guidelines that your GP may find useful; you can find a list of these in [the Hormones section on genderarchive.org.uk](https://genderarchive.org.uk/tag/hormones/).
