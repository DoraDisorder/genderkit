### Help! This all seems so overwhelming!

* *Don't rush!*

  ... There are a few things that take some time that you might want to get started with early, and we've listed these below.
* *Work out what you want*

  The information on this site is there to help you work out what's right for you. Think about what you might want to change, and look at the category to see what you can do to change it.

  Just because we've got an article on something, doesn't mean you need to get it; we're just trying to give you a good idea of what's out there so you can make your own decisions. More importantly, just because we *don't* list something, doesn't mean you can't look into getting it, though it might be hard to find good options.

### What can I do now?

* *Clothes*
* *Name change*
* *Finding supportive spaces*
* *Experimenting with pronouns*

### What should I plan ahead for?

* *Referrals*
* *Gender recognition certificate*

### Where can I learn more?
