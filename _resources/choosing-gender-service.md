To ensure that you choose an appropriate service, it is important to investigate:

{% include checklist checklist="genderservices" %}

A well-run service will be happy to help you with questions on these subjects. You may also find useful information on these subjects, and other people's thoughts and experiences of services, by searching [/r/transgenderuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderuk) for information.

### More things to consider

If you do not want to publicly change your gender presentation before starting hormones, you may want to check if the gender service is happy to prescribe hormones to you without evidence of public changes such as a deed poll name change.

If you would like your GP to agree to shared care with a private gender service, they may be more likely to do this if the gender service is staffed by clinicians who also work for NHS gender services. Private gender services will normally list which staff they employ, and you can search their names to find out whether they are also employed by the NHS. 

If you want to get a Gender Recognition Certificate, you may want to check whether the service has staff who are qualified to provide the Medical Report A evidence for your GRC application.

### Wait times

You can find out about wait times for NHS and private gender services on our [UK service wait times page]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}).

### Private fees

Costs for private services vary significantly. Most private gender services list information about fees on their websites:

- [GenderCare fees](https://gendercare.co.uk/fees.shtml)
- [Harley Street Gender Clinic fees](https://www.harleystgenderclinic.com/pricing)
- [London Transgender Clinic fees](https://www.thelondontransgenderclinic.uk/price-list/)
- [Dr Lenihan fees](https://www.drpennylenihan.co.uk/services)
- [YourGP fees](https://your-gp.com/gp-services/all-gp-services/gender-clinic/gender-dysphoria-consultation/)

You can find a summary of the costs of using private services that has been put together by community members in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/pvxt8b/comparison_of_private_providers_of_hrt_for_adults/). Appointments with private clinicians tend to cost £250-500, and you are likely to be asked to attend:

- at least one or two initial assessment appointments (or more if under 18)
- an appointment with an endocrinologist to be prescribed hormones
- periodic followup appointments with the endocrinologist

If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. Guidance on shared care that you may wish to give to your GP to help them make this decision has been produced by [NHS England](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) and [NHS Wales](https://awmsg.nhs.wales/files/guidelines-and-pils/shared-care-prescribing-and-monitoring-guidance-pdf/).

If your GP agrees to prescribe on the NHS, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If your GP does not agree to prescribe on the NHS, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of yourself. Typical prices for commonly used medications (as of February 2022) are:

- *testosterone gel*: around £50 for a two month supply
- *testosterone injections*: around £5-6 every 2-4 weeks for Sustanon, £100 for three months for Nebido
- *oestrogen gel*: around £10 for a 2-8 weeks supply
- *oestrogen patches*: around £10 for a 2-4 weeks supply
- *oestrogen pills*: around £10 for a 1-4 weeks supply
- *GnRH agonists*: around £250-300 for a 3 month supply

The private service may sometimes charge you an additional fee for writing the private prescription.

If you are taking a medication that is injected, you will also need injection supplies. You can find information about how to obtain these supplies cheaply and easily on [our self-injection page]({% link _resources/injections.md %}).

If your GP does not agree to perform blood testing for you, you will also need to arrange for this, which may cost you additional money. You can find out more about arranging blood testing on [our blood testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}).
