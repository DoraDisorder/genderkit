To ensure that you choose an appropriate service, it is important to investigate:

{% include checklist checklist="genderservices" %}

A well-run service will be happy to help you with questions on these subjects. You may also find useful information on these subjects, and other people's thoughts and experiences of services, by searching [/r/transgenderuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderuk) for information.

### More things to consider

If you do not want to publicly change your gender presentation before starting hormones, you may want to check if the gender service is happy to prescribe hormones to you without evidence of public changes such as a deed poll name change.

If you would like your GP to agree to shared care with a private gender service, they may be more likely to do this if the gender service is staffed by clinicians who also work for NHS gender services. Private gender services will normally list which staff they employ, and you can search their names to find out whether they are also employed by the NHS. 

If you want to get a Gender Recognition Certificate, you may want to check whether the service has staff who are qualified to provide the Medical Report A evidence for your GRC application.

### Fees

Costs for private services vary significantly. Most private gender services list information about fees on their websites:

- [GenderCare fees](https://gendercare.co.uk/fees.shtml)
- [Harley Street Gender Clinic fees](https://www.harleystgenderclinic.com/pricing)
- [London Transgender Clinic fees](https://www.thelondontransgenderclinic.uk/price-list/)
- [Dr Lenihan fees](https://www.drpennylenihan.co.uk/services)
- [YourGP fees](https://your-gp.com/gp-services/all-gp-services/gender-clinic/gender-dysphoria-consultation/)

You can find a summary of the costs of using private services that has been put together by community members in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderUK/comments/pvxt8b/comparison_of_private_providers_of_hrt_for_adults/).

If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
