To ensure that you choose an appropriate service, it is important to investigate:

{% include checklist checklist="genderservices" %}

A well-run service will be happy to help you with questions on these subjects. You may also find useful information on these subjects, and other people's thoughts and experiences of services, by searching [/r/transgenderuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderuk) for information.

### More things to consider

If you do not want to publicly change your gender presentation before starting hormones, you may want to check if the gender service is happy to prescribe hormones to you without evidence of public changes such as a deed poll name change.

If you would like your GP to agree to shared care with a private gender service, they may be more likely to do this if the gender service is staffed by clinicians who also work for NHS gender services. Private gender services will normally list which staff they employ, and you can search their names to find out whether they are also employed by the NHS. 

If you want to get a Gender Recognition Certificate, you may want to check whether the service has staff who are qualified to provide the Medical Report A evidence for your GRC application.
