### What surgeries are available?

The following surgeries are funded by the NHS for people with a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}):

{% include iconlist iconlist="surgery1" %}

There is a considerable wait to access medical support from the NHS. If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), you can pay for these surgeries yourself, which can mean a shorter wait.

The following surgeries are not normally funded by the NHS gender pathway:

While funding for these surgeries is not normally provided by the NHS gender services, approval for funding can sometimes be given on an individual basis. 

### How do I choose a surgical team?

For some surgeries there are a large number of teams that will offer the surgery in the UK. You can find a complete list of UK surgeons who can be accessed via the NHS on [the NGICNS website](https://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/nhsservices/adults/surgery/surgery-providers/). If you decide to fund your own surgery, rather than using NHS funding, there are more surgeons you can use both in the UK and abroad. 

You can find useful tips for deciding which surgery team to use on [the Umbrella Cymru website](https://umbrellagwent.od2.vtiger.com/kb/article/396664-Choosing-your-surgeon?catid=1&subid=4).

### How can I get ready for surgery?
