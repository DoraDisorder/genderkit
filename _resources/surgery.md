A large number of different surgeries are available, many of which are described on their own pages.

The different types of surgery can be found near the bottom of the following pages:

- [upper body]({% link _categories/upper-body.md %})
- [lower body]({% link _categories/lower-body.md %})
- [voice]({% link _categories/voice.md %})
- [face]({% link _categories/face.md %})

### Preparing for a surgical procedure

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).
