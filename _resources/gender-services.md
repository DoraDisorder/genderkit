In the UK, people who are changing things linked to gender are supported by a set of specialist centres, often known as "gender identity clinics" (GICs), which offer [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) and access to other services like hormone medications and surgeries. 

{% include gender-clinics tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true referrals=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}

All these services are now able to offer both phone and video appointments.

{% include gender-clinics tag="Gender Clinics" icon="pound" title="Paid UK-based services" free=false referrals=true description="There are also several privately run services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service." %}

### Choosing a service

To ensure that you choose an appropriate service, it is important to investigate:

{% include checklist checklist="genderservices" %}

A well-run service will be happy to help you with questions on these subjects. You may also find useful information on these subjects, and other people's thoughts and experiences of services, by searching [/r/transgenderuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderuk) for information.

### Waiting times

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the services or published on their website. Information on this page was last updated in August 2020. 

Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for their first appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait *longer* than the time shown on this page. The time shown on this page is the wait until a first appointment, but you are likely to be required to attend further appointments before receiving any medical treatments, which will involve further waiting.

### Getting a referral to an NHS clinic

If you're an adult, you can ask your GP for a referral to a specialist gender service, and they should refer you directly without first referring you to a local mental health team.

If you're a young person, you can ask your GP for a referral to one of the specialist youth gender services. You can see your GP without your parents present, and they shouldn't tell them about what you've discussed without your consent, though they may encourage you to talk to them yourself. If you're in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, you might be referred to a CAMHS team before being referred to a specialist gender service. If you're in Scotland, you can be referred to Sandyford's Young People's Gender Service directly.

If you're in Scotland (regardless of age), you can self-refer to Sandyford; see [their website](https://www.sandyford.scot/sexual-health-services/gender-identity-service/) for more information.

### Costs and funding

*British citizens* are able to access the NHS and HSC gender services for *free*. If you are not a British citizen, you may still be able to access these services for free, and more details can be found on the [Immigration page]({% link _resources/immigration.md %}).

Patients applying to Tavistock GIDS from Wales will need to ask their GP to apply for funding from their local CCG. 

You may be able to get help with the cost of travelling to attending appointments at NHS or HSC gender services. Further information about travel costs can be found:

- on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/help-with-health-costs/healthcare-travel-costs-scheme-htcs/) (valid across the whole of the UK)
- on [the Welsh Government website](https://gov.wales/low-income-scheme-help-nhs-health-costs)
- on [the NGICNS website](https://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/nhsservices/adults/surgery/claiming-travel-subsistence-expenses/) (Scotland only)
- on [the HSC Northern Ireland website](http://www.hscbusiness.hscni.net/pdf/Expenses.pdf)

More information about travel funding is also available on [the London GIC website](https://gic.nhs.uk/help-with-travel-costs/) and [the London GIDS website](https://gids.nhs.uk/how-claim-travel-expenses).

Costs for private services vary significantly. You can find price details on their websites, plus a comparison of estimated costs on the [Trans Health UK website](https://transhealthuk.noblogs.org/private-gender-clinics-services-prices/). If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
