In the UK, people who are changing things linked to gender are supported by a set of specialist centres, often known as "gender identity clinics" (GICs), which offer [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) and access to other services like hormone medications and surgeries. 

{% capture gic-description %}
You can access these gender services for free by [asking your GP to make a referral]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}). However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area.

You can find more information about waiting times - and which services will see you more quickly - on our [ UK service wait times page]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}).

All these services are now accepting referrals and able to offer both phone and video appointments.

{% capture gic-description %}
There are also a number of pilot schemes run by different organisations within NHS England. The purpose of these schemes is to explore a more holistic and comprehensive model of how gender clinics can function, with patient agency centred more in the process.

These clinics generally have a much shorter wait, but are only open to people who've already been referred to another clinic, and who meet particular requirements. Waits vary, usually depending on how long you've been on the waiting list for the other clinic.

{% capture gic-description %}
There are also several private gender services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service.

You can find the waiting times for these services on our [ UK service wait times page]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}#paid-uk-based-services).

{% include checklist checklist="genderservices" %}

A well-run service will be happy to help you with questions on these subjects. You may also find useful information on these subjects, and other people's thoughts and experiences of services, by searching [/r/transgenderuk](https://www.reddit.com/r/transgenderuk) for information.


### Getting a referral to an NHS clinic

If you're an adult, you can ask your GP for a referral to a specialist gender service, and they should refer you directly without first referring you to a local mental health team.

If you're a young person, you can ask your GP for a referral to one of the specialist youth gender services. You can see your GP without your parents present, and they shouldn't tell them about what you've discussed without your consent, though they may encourage you to talk to them yourself. If you're in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, you might be referred to a CAMHS team before being referred to a specialist gender service. If you're in Scotland, you can be referred to Sandyford's Young People's Gender Service directly.

If you're in Scotland (regardless of age), you can self-refer to Sandyford; see [their website](https://www.sandyford.scot/sexual-health-services/gender-identity-service/) for more information.

All the private gender services accept self-referral. However, it may be helpful to speak to your GP before self-referring to a private service, to find out if your GP will be able to support your treatment and if they are able to support you with blood tests and prescribing.

### How much will it cost?

*British citizens* are able to access the NHS and HSC gender services for *free*. If you are not a British citizen, you may still be able to access these services for free, and more details can be found on the [Immigration page]({% link _resources/immigration.md %}).

Patients applying to Tavistock GIDS from Wales will need to ask their GP to apply for funding from their local CCG. 

You may be able to get help with the cost of travelling to attending appointments at NHS or HSC gender services. Further information about travel costs can be found:

- on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/help-with-health-costs/healthcare-travel-costs-scheme-htcs/) (valid across the whole of the UK)
- on [the Welsh Government website](https://gov.wales/low-income-scheme-help-nhs-health-costs)
- on [the NGICNS website](https://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/nhsservices/adults/surgery/claiming-travel-subsistence-expenses/) (Scotland only)
- on [the HSC Northern Ireland website](http://www.hscbusiness.hscni.net/pdf/Expenses.pdf)

More information about travel funding is also available on [the London GIC website](https://gic.nhs.uk/help-with-travel-costs/) and [the London GIDS website](https://gids.nhs.uk/how-claim-travel-expenses).

Costs for private services vary significantly. You can find price details on their websites, plus a comparison of estimated costs on the [Trans Health UK website](https://transhealthuk.noblogs.org/covid-19-private-clinics/). If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
