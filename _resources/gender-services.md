In the UK, people who are changing things linked to gender are supported by a set of specialist centres, usually known as "gender clinics", which offer diagnosis and access to other services like medications. 

You can access these gender clinics for free by asking your GP to make a referral to a gender clinic. However, NHS and HSC clinics have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. There are also several privately run clinics which charge money but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists.

### Waiting times

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the clinics or published on the website of a clinic. Information on this page was last updated in April 2020. 

Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for their first appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait *longer* than the time shown on this page. The time shown on this page is the wait until a first appointment, but you are likely to be required to attend further appointments before receiving any medical treatments, which will involve further waiting.

### Costs and funding

*British citizens* are all able to access the NHS and HSC gender clinics for *free*. If you are not a British citizen, you may still be able to access these services for free, and more details can be found on the [Immigration page]({% link _resources/immigration.md %}). 

If you are using private gender services to obtain medications, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
