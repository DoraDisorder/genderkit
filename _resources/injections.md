Some medications on this site might be prescribed to you as injections. These will normally be injected by a doctor or nurse at your GP surgery or at a clinic. However, some people choose to either inject these medications themselves, or have a friend or family member do it for them.

If you do want to inject yourself, or have a friend or family member do so, it's important to take the proper safety measures. This includes getting the right injection supplies from the right places, making sure they are clean, and disposing of them properly.

### Why you might want to inject at home

You might want to inject at home:
* Because it’s more *convenient*
* Because you’re more *comfortable* in your own home than a doctor's office or clinic
* Because you’re taking an *extended trip away* where you won’t have easy access to a clinic
* Because you *can’t find a clinician* in your area who will perform the injection
* If you’re *already self-injecting* other medicines

### Where to get injection supplies

You will normally need:

* Unused needles of the correct sizes (needle sizes are known as [gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_gauge))
* Pre-injection swabs
* A sharps bin

You may be able to have these prescribed to you. You can also buy these from your local pharmacy or online medical suppliers. If you’re buying medical supplies online, make sure it’s from a reputable medical supplier, rather than a generic website like Amazon.

For any injected drug, it is important that you always use fresh needles. If you're injecting yourself and you're not sure where you can get fresh needles, look for a local *needle exchange*. These are organisations that will take used needles and replace them with fresh, sterile ones.

For more information about needle exchanges and where to find them, see [the With You website](https://www.wearewithyou.org.uk/what-we-do/visiting-needle-exchange/).

### How to inject medications

Brighton Health and Wellbeing Centre have video guides on how to do inject medications commonly used:

* For [Sustanon](https://www.brightonhealthandwellbeingcentre.co.uk/selfcare/b12-sustanon-injections)
* For [Nebido and Decapeptyl](https://www.brightonhealthandwellbeingcentre.co.uk/selfcare/nebido-decapeptyl-injections)

Leeds Gender Identity Team have also produced a more detailed [guide to injecting Sustanon](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leedsandyorkpft.nhs.uk%2Four-services%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F2%2F2021%2F05%2FHow-to-give-a-Testosterone-Intramuscular-IM-Injection.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK).

### Disposing of injection supplies

Used needles should be put into a dedicated sharps bin. This is a special type of bin for objects like needles and scalpels that makes it easier to dispose of them safely. 

You can find more information about how to use a sharps bin on [the NHS England website](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-should-i-dispose-of-used-needles-or-sharps/).

You can bring the sharps bin to a needle exchange programme, some pharmacies, or your local council may offer a collection service. Make sure the bin is properly sealed before you try to take it anywhere.
