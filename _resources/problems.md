### How do I get my problem fixed?

Here's how to handle some common issues with the UK healthcare system:

- *My GP doesn't know how to update my name or gender marker*

    You can find information about what to tell your GP surgery staff on [our Updating NHS Records page]({% link _articles/updating-nhs-patient-details.md %}).

- *My GP doesn't know how to refer me to a gender service*

    First check to see if it is possible to refer yourself to the gender service instead. You can find this information on [our UK Gender Services page]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}).

    If your GP is unsure what the next step should be, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions) - it is their responsibility to read this information and be familiar with it. If you're still not able to get a referral, you may find contacting the service you want to be referred to can support you in getting a referral.

- *I have a problem with my hormone treatment*

    First speak to the person who monitors your hormone therapy - often, this is your GP. 
    
    If they are unsure how to help, you can suggest they get advice from one of these sources:

    - NHS prescribing policies for trans people
    - an endocrinologist who originally recommended your hormone therapy
    - the endocrinology team at an NHS gender service
    - a local NHS endocrinology team if there is one in your area with expertise working with trans patients

- *I have a problem with my gender surgery referral*

    If you have problems with your gender surgery referral, the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Services (GDNRSS) have a Single Point of Access support line that you can call for information and advice about your referral. You can read how to access the service in [this booklet](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/v2-gender-dysphoria-about-us-booklet-pdf/).

- *My GP isn't willing to offer bridging prescriptions*

    - self-medication is not illegal
    - existing hormone prescriptions should not be abruptly stopped
    - bridging prescriptions guides

- *My GP isn't willing to offer shared care or blood testing*

    - GP can choose whether to offer shared care
    - What you can show them that might help
    - You can read about other places you can get blood tests from on [our Blood Testing page]({% link _resources/blood-testing.md %}).

- *My GP isn't willing to perform injections for me*

    - What should we write here?

- *I have another problem with my GP surgery*

    If you're having a problem with the care you're receiving from a GP, start by talking to the reception staff of the GP surgery in question by email or phone call.

### That didn't help, what can I do?

If you want to make a complaint, read [our page on how to do it]({% link _resources/complaints.md %}).

If your GP is not supportive or is being unhelpful, you might want to consider:

- *speaking to the practice manager*

    The practice manager is the head of the whole GP surgery. You can request to talk to the practice manager on the phone or in-person, and this is often the quickest way to get problems resolved if you're experiencing issues talking to staff that they manage.

- *switching to a different GP at the surgery*

    You have the right to change to a different GP at your GP surgery without giving a reason why. You can also ask that you are given appointments with any GP except for one you are uncomfortable with.

- *changing to another GP surgery*

    You can search for GP surgeries near to you that the trans community have found helpful on [the Trans Healthcare Info GP map](https://www.transhealthcareintel.com/trans-friendly-gps) or [the Trans Aid Cymru Welsh GP map](https://transaid.cymru/our-projects/#gpmap).

- *changing to an online GP service*

    Some online services specifically advertise support for LGBT+ and trans people, such as [GP At Hand](https://www.babylonhealth.com/en-gb/lgbtq).

You can also get support to help you resolve your problem:

- in London, people over 18 can access [the Spectra Trans Health Advocacy Service](https://spectra-london.org.uk/trans-services/trans-health-advocacy/)
- in Manchester and Greater Manchester, people over 16 can access [the LGBT Foundation Trans Advocacy service](http://lgbt.foundation/how-we-can-help-you/trans-advocacy)
