description: Information about hormone replacement therapies used by people changing things linked to gender
---

We have pages with information about the most commonly used medications in hormone replacement therapy for people who are changing things about their body linked to gender:

- [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %})
- [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})
- [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) ("blockers") which block the effects of oestrogen and testosterone
- [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}) and [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) help block the effects of testostrone but often have more side effects
- [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}) (an oestrogen blocker not normally used in the UK)
