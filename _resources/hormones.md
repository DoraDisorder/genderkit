We have pages with information about the most commonly used medications in hormone replacement therapy for people who are changing things about their body linked to gender:

- [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %})
- [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %})
- [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) ("blockers") which block the effects of oestrogen and testosterone
- [spironolactone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}) and [cyproterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) help block the effects of testostrone but often have more side effects
