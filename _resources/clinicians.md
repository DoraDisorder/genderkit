### National policies

Each nation's public health body has published a policy for how patients should be treated.

- **NHS England**: [Gender Dysphoria Protocol](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/int-gend-proto.pdf). NHS England have also published information for GPs on [prescribing and monitoring hormones](http://www.dorsetccg.nhs.uk/Downloads/aboutus/medicines-management/Other%20Guidelines/Specialised%20services%20circular.pdf) and information for GPs on handling [requests from private medical service providers](https://gendergp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf).
- **NHS Scotland**: [Gender Reassignment Protocol](http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2012_26.pdf). You should also read [Interim Guidance](http://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gender-Reassignment-Interim-Guidance-2.pdf) which contains updates to the protocol. Some [explanatory notes](http://www.ngicns.scot.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/NGICNS-Explanatory-Notes-for-GRP-v1-0-2.pdf) have been published which may help you.
