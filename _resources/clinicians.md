### General guidance

The GMC have created a [trans healthcare hub](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare) that gives information on how to treat trans and non-binary people. This is the most important information to read about how to support your patients.

BMJ subscribers can also access [BMJ Best Practice - Gender dysphoria in adults](https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/992).
