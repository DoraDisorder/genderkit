TODO: something about
- who will generally be in a first appointment
- you will normally be asked a number of questions. you may not know all the answers to all these questions yet, this is okay
- you will normally not get hormones prescribed straight away after a first appointment with an NHS service; this is normally after a second appointment
- what shouldn't happen in a first appointment

### Questions to expect

In general, you will be asked about three main things in an assessment appointment: your past, your current situation, and your future plans.

Common questions about *your past* include:

- When did you start feeling like something was wrong?
- During childhood, did you experiment with or use clothes, makeup, hair associated with a different gender?
- What was it like for you going through puberty?
- Have you had physical relationships in the past? How have you found this?

Common questions about *your current situation* include:

- What things cause you to experience gender dysphoria now?
- Are you living "full-time" in your new gender role yet? Has this helped you?
- If not, what are your plans to make this happen? Do you have a plan in place to come out in your workplace, school, or university?
- Are your family, partner, children, work, and social circles aware and supportive? Have you experienced any issues in any of these areas?
- What is your sexual orientation?
- Do you have any physical or mental health conditions?

Common questions about *your future plans* include:

- Do you want to access hormone therapy? How do you think this might help you?
- Are you seeking fertility preservation prior to hormone therapy?
- Do you want to access surgery? How do you think this will help you?
- Are you aware that getting genital surgery is irreversible?

### Private services

You may be asked some additional questions in a consultation with a private service:

- Have you spoken to your GP about shared care and are they supportive?
- Have you requested a referral to the NHS gender system as well?
