### What happens in the appointment?

At most services, your first appointment is a conversation between you and a clinician (who might be a doctor, nurse, psychologist, or psychiatrist). Sometimes, there might be more than one clinician there. You will normally be asked a number of questions. You may not know all the answers to all these questions yet - don't worry if this is the case. You can also ask questions of your own. The appointment could be via video call, or in person at the gender service. Normally, these appointment last around an hour.

In appointments at a gender service, you should *not* be asked to let someone examine your chest or genitalia, unless this person is a surgeon assessing you for surgery on that part of your body.

### What can I do before my appointment?

Think about whether it would be helpful to have someone with you in the appointment, or to travel to the appointment with you. Do you find it difficult to explain things clearly? Do you feel able to say no to things you are not comfortable with? Would having someone else there make you feel more comfortable?

If you’ve made a [name change by deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [name change by statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}) already, make sure you have this handy in case it is needed.

If you’ve already been given a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) by another service, find out when this was made. You may have an appointment letter or email that tells you this.

If you’ve already started on hormone therapy, find out when this happened. You may have an appointment letter or email that tells you this.

You’ll be asked a number of questions about yourself in the appointment. We’ve listed common questions below. You might want to think about them beforehand so that you feel confident to answer them in your appointment.

You might also want to think about what questions you want to ask. Do you have questions about how hormones, surgery, fertility preservation, or speech and language therapy work? Do you want to know what will happen next? Many people find it can be helpful to write a list of questions to keep with them in the appointment so they don’t forget anything.

### What questions will I be asked?

In general, you will be asked about three main things in an assessment appointment: your past, your current situation, and your future plans.

Common questions about *your past* include:

- When did you start feeling like something was wrong?
- During childhood, did you experiment with or use clothes, makeup, hair associated with a different gender?
- What was it like for you going through puberty?
- Have you had physical relationships in the past? How have you found this?

Common questions about *your current situation* include:

- What things cause you to experience gender dysphoria now?
- Are you living "full-time" in your new gender role yet? Has this helped you?
- If not, what are your plans to make this happen? Do you have a plan in place to come out in your workplace, school, or university?
- Are your family, partner, children, work, and social circles aware and supportive? Have you experienced any issues in any of these areas?
- What is your sexual orientation?
- Do you have any physical or mental health conditions?

Common questions about *your future plans* include:

- Do you want to access hormone therapy? How do you think this might help you?
- Are you seeking fertility preservation prior to hormone therapy?
- Do you want to access surgery? How do you think this will help you?
- Are you aware that getting genital surgery is irreversible?

### Private services

You may be asked some additional questions in a consultation with a private service:

- Have you spoken to your GP about shared care and are they supportive?
- Have you requested a referral to the NHS gender system as well?

### What happens next?

After your appointment, you should receive a letter which has been sent to you and your GP. This should summarise what happened in your appointment and what will happen next.

After a first appointment with an NHS service, you will normally need to be seen for at least one more appointment before you are given any hormone prescriptions.
