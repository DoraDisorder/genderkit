### Important notes

Waiting time information shown on this page is taken from information given directly to us by the services or published on their website.

Waiting times indicate how long patients who have just been invited for their first appointment have waited for. As demand is currently increasing over time, this means it is likely you will wait *longer* than the time shown on this page. The time shown on this page is the wait until a first appointment, but you are likely to be required to attend further appointments before receiving any medical treatments, which will involve further waiting.

Many gender services currently have very lengthy wait lists, and it can be very difficult to be waiting for so long. You can find ways you can get help while you are waiting on [our Mental Health page]({% link _resources/mental-health.md %}).

If you switch from the wait list of one gender service to another, how long you wait for an appointment may take into account how long you have already waited, but not all services offer this. If you are considering switching from one gender service to another, you may wish to contact them to find out whether your existing wait time may be taken into account by the new service.

### Summary information

Stuff stuff stuff.

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="tick" title="Free UK-based services" free=true referrals=true description="You can access these gender services for free by asking your GP to make a referral. However, these services have significant waiting lists, and may require a wait of several years before being seen. They will also only accept you as a patient if you are registered with a GP in a specific area." %}

All these services are now accepting referrals and able to offer both phone and video appointments.

{% include wait-summary tag="Gender Clinics" icon="pound" title="Paid UK-based services" free=false referrals=true description="There are also several private gender services which charge fees but which may have significantly shorter waiting lists. You may wish to use these services while on the waiting list for an NHS service." %}
