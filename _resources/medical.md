### How to use medical services 
   
1. *Decide if you need medical gender services*

   Read [our formal diagnosis page]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) to find out if you need to use a medical service. 
2. *Choose which services to use*

   Read [our tips for choosing a gender service]({% link _resources/choosing-gender-service.md %}) - we have a full [list of UK private and NHS services]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) including details about current [wait times]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}) and [costs]({% link _resources/private-fees.md %}). If you can afford it, go for both a private and NHS referral.
3. *Get referrals to your chosen services*

   Read [our page on how to get a referral]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}) to find out how to get on the wait list. If you’d like hormone therapy, you may want to ask your GP for a [bridging prescription](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions) at this point.
4. *Have your first appointment*

   Read [our first appointments at gender services page]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}) so you know what to expect when you get to the end of the waiting list.
5. *Have your second appointment*

   Over 18s are normally offered hormones after their second appointment. If you are using a private service, *shared care* with your GP would normally start after this appointment.
6. *Get medical treatment*

   Read our [hormones]({% link _resources/hormones.md %}) and [surgery]({% link _resources/surgery.md %}) pages for detailed information about what to expect. If you’ve started treatment with a private service, when you reach the end of the NHS wait list they should take over hormone treatment, but may make a second assessment of you. 

### If you have problems
We have guidance on how to *resolve common problems* and *how to make a complaint*.
