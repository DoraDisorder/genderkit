### How do I use medical services?
   
1. *Decide if you need medical support*

   Read [our formal diagnosis page]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) to find out if you need to use a medical service. 
2. *Choose which services to use*

   Read [our tips for choosing a gender service]({% link _resources/choosing-gender-service.md %}) - we have a full [list of UK private and NHS services]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) including details about current [wait times]({% link _resources/wait-times.md %}) and [costs]({% link _resources/private-fees.md %}). If you can afford it, and are over 18, getting both a private and an NHS referral can help you access hormones more quickly.
3. *Get your referrals*

   Read [our page on how to get a referral to a medical gender service]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}) to find out how to get on the wait list. If youâ€™d like hormone therapy, you may want to ask your GP for a [bridging prescription](https://www.transactual.org.uk/bridging-prescriptions) at this point.
4. *Have your assessment appointments*

   Read [our first appointments at gender services page]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}) so you know what to expect. You must have at least two assessment appointments. Under 18s must have at least three appointments and normally more.

5. *Under 18 only: further assessment*

   Young people have two additional assessment appointments with the UCLH team.
6. *Under 18 only: get puberty blockers*

   Young people may then be offered [GnRH agonist]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) medication.
7. *Approval for hormone treatment*

   You may be allowed to start hormones at this point if either:
   - you are over 18
   - or you are over 15 and have taken blockers for more than a year
   
   Read our [hormones page]({% link _resources/hormones.md %}) for more information about hormones.
8. *Referral for surgery if you want it*

   Read our [surgery page]({% link _resources/surgery.md %}) for more information. Surgeries are only available to over 18s.

### What do I do if something goes wrong?

We have information about [fixing common problems]({% link _resources/problems.md %}) and about [making a complaint]({% link _resources/complaints.md %}).
