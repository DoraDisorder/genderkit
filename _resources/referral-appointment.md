### What happens when I ask for a referral?

The person referring you should ask you a few questions. This is so they can provide the information that the service they are referring you to has asked for. There is a list of common questions you might be asked further down the page.

The person referring you may take your height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size, and may ask you to have some blood drawn for testing.

The person referring you might also ask you if you want to update your name or gender on their records.

If you are asking for a referral to a service for children and young people, your GP may suggest you are referred to your local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) first, who may ask you the questions above and may also ask you more questions, particularly around your mental health. 

### What should not happen when I ask for a referral?

The person who you have asked for a referral should *not*:

-   ask you to let them examine your chest or genitalia
-   tell you to go to a mental health service or counsellor (unless you are under 18)
-   tell you that no help is available to you

### What might I be asked?

Many clinics publish their referral form on their website, so you can look ahead to see exactly which questions your GP might ask you. 

Common questions that GPs might ask include:

-   What is your sex assigned at birth?
-   What is your current gender identity and pronouns?
-   Have you previously attended a gender clinic?
-   Do you have a DSD or intersex diagnosis?
-   Do you need any support to attend appointments (e.g. an interpreter, advocate, carer?)
-   When did you start feeling something was wrong related to gender?
-   Did you do or try anything during childhood, like clothes, hair, makeup, etc?
-   Are you taking any hormones already?
-   Are you “full-time” yet?
-   Have you made a name change? If not, do you have a preferred name?
-   Have you updated your NHS records?
-   Do you have any mental health diagnoses?
-   Do you have a diagnosis of ADHD, autism, learning disabilities, or a developmental disorder?
-   What medications do you currently take?
-   Do you use any recreational drugs? Do you drink? Do you smoke?
-   Do you have a criminal record?
-   Do you have a history of self-harm or suicide?

You might also be asked:

-   About your own medical history, or about whether you have a family history of certain medical conditions
-   Where do you live? Who do you live with?
-   Are you employed? Are you in education?  

If you’re being referred to a service for young people, you are likely to be asked:
-   Whether you have experienced any bullying
-   Whether you have experienced any abuse
