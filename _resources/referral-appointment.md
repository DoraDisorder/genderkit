To get medical treatment related to gender, you normally need to be referred to a specialist gender service, often called a “gender clinic” or GIC. This is just like being referred for any other kind of medical treatment.

### How do I get a referral?

Private gender services let you refer yourself - the website for the service will tell you how. Normally they will ask you to send them an email or fill in a form on their website.

Some NHS gender services also let you refer yourself. You can refer yourself to one of these services by filling out a form downloaded from their website and emailing it to them. You can find out which NHS services allow self-referral on our [list of gender services]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}).

To be referred to a NHS gender service which don't allow self-referral, you will need to make an appointment to speak to your GP. This could be an appointment to speak on the telephone, or an appointment to speak in person.

### How do I ask my GP for a referral?

In your GP appointment, you should tell your GP that you want them to refer you to a gender service. If you are living in England, you may be asked which gender service you wish to be referred to. If you don’t know what clinics there are, we have our own page with a [list of gender services]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}).

What happens next depends on your age:

- *if you're under 17*, depending on where you live, your GP might need to refer you to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) first. CAMHS can then refer on to gender services. You can see your GP without your parents present, and the GP shouldn't tell your parents about what you've talked about without your consent, though they might encourage you to talk to them yourself.
- *if you're 17 or over*, your GP should always refer you straight to the gender service. You should *not* be asked to use a mental health service or counsellor. 

The person making the referral may take your height, weight, blood pressure, and waist size, and may ask you to have some blood drawn for testing. They might also ask you if you want to update your name or gender on their records. They should *not* ask you to let them examine your chest or genitalia.

The person making the referral will ask you a list of questions.

### What might I be asked?

Many clinics publish their referral form on their website, so you can look ahead to see exactly which questions you might be asked.

Common questions that you will likely be asked include:

- What is your current gender identity and pronouns?
- Have you previously attended a gender clinic?
- Are you taking any hormones already?
- Do you need any support to attend appointments (e.g. an interpreter, advocate, carer?)
- What medications do you currently take? 

Specific questions about gender you could be asked are:

- When did you start feeling something was wrong related to gender?
- Did you experiment with gender during childhood (clothes, hair, makeup, etc)?
- Have you made a name change? If not, do you have a preferred name?
- Have you updated your NHS records?
- Have you made any public changes to your gender presentation?

The person referring you will need to list which medical conditions you have on your referral. This may you are asked questions about your medical history or family medical history. In particular, you are likely to be asked if you have any of the following:

- mental health conditions
- DSD or intersex conditions
- ADHD or autism
- learning disabilities or a developmental disorder
- a history of self-harming or suicidal behaviour

You might also be asked:

- Do you use any recreational drugs? Do you drink? Do you smoke?
- Do you have a criminal record?
- Where do you live? Who do you live with?
- Are you employed? Are you in education?

If you’re being referred to a service for young people, you are likely to be asked:

- whether your parents or guardians are happy for you to be referred
- whether you have experienced any bullying
- whether you have experienced any abuse

### What can I do beforehand?

Think about whether it would be helpful to have someone with you when you ask for a referral. Do you find it difficult to explain things clearly? Do you find it hard to say no to things that make you uncomfortable? Would having someone else there make you feel more comfortable?

You might want to think about the questions that are usually asked in a referral appointment beforehand, so that you feel confident to answer them in your appointment.

### What happens next?

After you’ve been referred, most services send a confirmation letter to you, letting you know you have been added to their waiting list. This usually takes a few weeks. If you’ve not heard back within a month, it may be worth phoning or emailing to check that your referral has been received correctly.

Most services will say on their website how long you can expect to wait, and how long people who are currently being offered appointments have been waiting. You might find it helpful to write down what date your referral was made for later reference.

While you are waiting, you could look into:

- what changes you can make that don’t require having been seen by a gender service - if you’re not sure where to start, check out [our Getting Started article]({% link _resources/getting-started.md %})
- what support you could get on [our page on support services]({% link _articles/support-services.md %})
- connecting with other people in similar situations through [local organisations]({% link _resources/local.md %})

You can also prepare for when you are seen by the gender service. You can read more about this on [our page about your first appointment at a gender service]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}).

### Dealing with problems

If your GP is unsure what the next step should be, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions), or the resources on our [Information for clinicians]({% link _resources/clinicians.md %}) page.
