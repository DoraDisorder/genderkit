### Supporting staff

We have a separate page of [information for employers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _resources/employers.md %}) that gives advice on supporting your staff.

### Example resources and policies

A number of local authorities and organisations have produced resources or policies specifically for schools in their area.

{% include publications tag="University policies" %}

### Student organisations

Some universities have active student organisations that specialise in supporting trans, non-binary, and gender diverse students. Here are some examples. We encourage you to consult with student organisations before creating new guidance or policies and before organising events related to gender diversity.
