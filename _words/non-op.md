Non-op is short for "non-operative", meaning someone who does not plan to undergo a medical operation.

The typical implication is that this refers to someone who does not plan to have bottom surgery (surgery to alter the genitals).

People who plan to have such surgery may be described as [pre-op]({% link _words/pre-op.md %}). People who have already had such surgery are sometimes described as [post-op]({% link _words/post-op.md %}).
