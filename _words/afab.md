AFAB is short for "assigned female at birth".

It is used by people who were listed as female on their birth certificate.

Sometimes other terms are used:

- *DAFAB* - designated as female at birth
- *FAAB* - female assigned at birth
- *CAFAB* - coercively assigned female at birth

Babies who are assigned male at birth are instead described as [AMAB]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/amab.md %}).

Not all babies are assigned male or female at birth, with some  [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) babies being left unassigned.
