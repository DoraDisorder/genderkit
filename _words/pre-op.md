Pre-op is short for "pre-operative", meaning someone who has not had a medical operation yet.

The typical implication is that this refers to someone who has not had bottom surgery (surgery to alter the genitals).

Pre-op is normally considered to be the opposite of [post-op]({% link _words/post-op.md %}). People who do not plan to have such surgery are sometimes described as [non-op]({% link _words/non-op.md %}).
