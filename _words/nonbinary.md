Nonbinary is an umbrella term covering any gender identity that doesn't fit within the gender binary (the way of thinking about gender that separates people into either "male" or "female").

"Non-binary people are those who don't feel male or female. They may feel like both or like something in between. They may have a gender that changes over time or they may not relate to gender at all" -- [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32979297)

"Denoting or relating to a gender or sexual identity that is not defined in terms of traditional binary oppositions such as male and female or homosexual and heterosexual." -- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/nonbinary)

Nonbinary is sometimes abbreviated to "NB" or [enby]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/enby.md %}).

A term with a similar meaning is [genderqueer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/genderqueer.md %}).

### Nonbinary people and transgender people

Many nonbinary people consider themselves to be [transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/transgender.md %}), but some do not.

You should only describe nonbinary people as transgender if they have called themselves transgender.

To include nonbinary people who are not transgender, many organisations use the language "transgender and nonbinary people".
