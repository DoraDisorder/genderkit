Post-op is short for "post-operative", meaning someone who has undergone a medical operation.

The typical implication is that this refers to someone who has  had bottom surgery (surgery to alter the genitals).

Post-op is normally considered to be the opposite of [pre-op]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/pre-op.md %}). People who do not plan to have such surgery are sometimes described as [non-op]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/non-op.md %}).
