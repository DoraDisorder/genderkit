AMAB is short for "assigned male at birth".

It is used by people who were listed as male on their birth certificate.

Sometimes other terms are used:

- *DAMAB* - designated as male at birth
- *MAAB* - male assigned at birth
- *CAMAB* - coercively assigned male at birth

Babies who are assigned female at birth are instead described as [AFAB]({% link _words/afab.md %}).

Not all babies are assigned male or female at birth, with some  [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) babies being left unassigned.
