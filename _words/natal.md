"Natal" is an outdated medical term used to describe the sex you were assigned at birth. 

In almost all cases where this term could be used, it is better to use [AFAB]({% link _words/afab.md %}), [AMAB]({% link _words/amab.md %}), or [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) instead. These words have far fewer problems associated with them.
 
This term can can:
- be used to imply some people are "fake"
- reduce people to their genetics, rather than who they are as a person
- invalidate the identities of [intersex]({% link _words/intersex.md %}) people

This term is now falling out of use. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this term to describe other people unless you are absolutely sure they are happy for you to do so, and that other people around you will not be upset by it.
