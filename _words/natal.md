"Natal" is an outdated medical term used to describe the sex you were assigned at birth. 

In almost all cases where this term could be used, it is better to use [AFAB]({% link _words/afab.md %}), [AMAB]({% link _words/amab.md %}), or [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) instead. These words have far fewer problems associated with them.
