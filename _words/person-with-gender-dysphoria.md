"Gender dysphoria" is a medical term used to describe a feeling of discomfort with your body, or discomfort with the gender people are treating you as.

"Gender dysphoria is the distress associated with the experience of
oneâ€™s personal gender identity being inconsistent with the [phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype) means or the
gender role typically associated with that phenotype." -- [Royal College of Psychiatrists](https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/improving-care/better-mh-policy/college-reports/college-report-cr181.pdf)
