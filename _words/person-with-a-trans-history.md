"Person with a trans history" is term sometimes used by people who used to identify as [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _words/trans.md %}) because they felt that their body did not fit with their gender identity.

After medical and social changes, they may now feel the two are aligned, and refer to themselves as being a person with a trans history instead.

However, many people still wish to be referred to as trans even after making social or medical changes, and do not use the term "person with trans history" to describe themselves.
