title: Gender reassignment
groups: [Legal term, Medical treatment]
---
This term has two different meanings depending on context.

*Legal definition*

According to the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/7), a person has the protected characteristic of "gender reassignment" if that person:

> "is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person's sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex."

UK law makes it unlawful to discriminate against anyone on the basis of their gender reassignment. It also makes it unlawful to discriminate against someone because they are perceived to be undergoing gender reassignment, even if they aren't.

This legal definition applies to you regardless of what you have or have not had any particular treatment, and is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes people who have only had social aspects of transition such as a name change. 

*Medical definition*

In medicine, the term "gender reassignment" can refer to any medical treatment to do with gender, but most often refers to "bottom" surgeries such as [vaginoplasty]({% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}), [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}), or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}).
