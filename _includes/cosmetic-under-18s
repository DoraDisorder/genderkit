There is no set lower age limit for cosmetic facial surgery. However, the General Medical Council recommend {% cite gmc-cosmetic %} that:

* Cosmetic surgeries must only be given to minors when it is in their best interests
* Even if you have [capacity to consent]({% link _resources/capacity.md %}), you will be encouraged to involve your parents in the decision
* If you do not want to have a cosmetic surgery, you should not have one, even if your parents consent on your behalf
* Cosmetic surgeries should not be marketed towards under 18s
