{% if include.optional %}If you're taking this as an injection, {% else %}For any injected drug,{% endif %} it is important that you always use fresh needles. If you're injecting yourself and you're not sure where you can get fresh needles, look for a local *needle exchange*. These are organisations that will take used needles and replace them with fresh, sterile ones.

Used needles should be put into a dedicated sharps bin. This is a special type of bin for objects like needles and scalpels that makes it easier to dispose of them safely. You can bring the sharps bin to a needle exchange programme, some pharmacies, or your local council may offer a collection service. Make sure the bin is properly sealed before you try to take it anywhere.

If your injections are being done by a doctor or nurse, they should make sure the needles are sterile and dispose of them properly.
