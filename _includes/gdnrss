### Where can I get support?

When you and your clinical team agree that you are ready for surgery on the NHS, the NHS Gender Dysphoria National Referral Support Services (GDNRSS) will process your referral to your chosen surgical provider. They have a Single Point of Access support line that you can call for information about your referral, the status of your chosen provider and practical information such as travel and parking, who can accompany you, what to take with you and where to report when you get there.

The phone number to call is 01522 85 77 99. The lines are open Monday to Friday from 9am until 5pm. You can find out more about this service in [this booklet](https://cavuhb.nhs.wales/files/specialised-medicine/welsh-gender-service/v2-gender-dysphoria-about-us-booklet-pdf/).
