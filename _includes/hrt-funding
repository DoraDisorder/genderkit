Oestrogen therapy is not usually provided to under-18s on the NHS, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when oestrogen therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide oestrogen to selected 16 and 17 year old people {% cite gids2016 %}.

Under-16s attending the GIDS clinic in England will require a 'best interests' court judgement to receive this treatment {% cite specEngDec20Update %}.

You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland]( https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
