      <h3>Finding your identity</h3>
      <p>You're allowed to be whoever you like. No-one can tell you who you are. Everyone is unique and is not fully described by any label or combination of labels.</p>
      <p>Sooner or later, however, you will find you will need to use words to describe yourself to other people. There are a number of common words - terms - used to describe people, which all have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
      <h3>Commonly used terms</h3>
