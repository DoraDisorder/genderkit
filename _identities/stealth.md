A "stealth" [transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %}) person is one who has transitioned to live in a different gender and who is not informing those around them of their gender history.

In places which are less tolerant, being stealth is helpful to avoid discrimination and violence.
