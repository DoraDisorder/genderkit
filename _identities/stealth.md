A "stealth" [transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %}) person is one who has transitioned to live in a different gender and who is not informing those around them of their gender history.

In places which are less tolerant, being stealth is helpful to avoid discrimination and violence. Thankfully, with better acceptance of [transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %}) people, this is becoming something which is an option rather than a necessity.
