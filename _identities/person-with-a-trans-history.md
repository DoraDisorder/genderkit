"Person with a trans history" is term used by people who used to identify as [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans.md %}) because they felt that their body did not fit with their gender identity.

After medical and social changes, they may now feel the two are aligned, and refer to themselves as having a trans history instead.
