title: Drag king
---

"A woman who dresses up as a man; a male impersonator." -- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/drag_king)

Drag kings are entertainers who perform in costume and makeup that exaggerates masculine qualities. They adopt a persona which is a man, but normally are people who identify as a woman in everyday life.  

An entertainer who instead exaggerates female qualities is known as a [drag queen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/drag-queen.md %}).

Drag exists as part of [ball culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture), a primarily non-white subculture in the US, though drag queens and kings also exist outside of this tradition. People adopting drag queen or drag king identities should be aware of the risk of [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation).
