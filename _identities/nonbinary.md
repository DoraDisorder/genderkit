Nonbinary is an umbrella term covering any gender identity that doesn't fit within a gender binary.

"Non-binary people are those who don't feel male or female. They may feel like both or like something in between. They may have a gender that changes over time or they may not relate to gender at all" -- [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32979297)

"Denoting or relating to a gender or sexual identity that is not defined in terms of traditional binary oppositions such as male and female or homosexual and heterosexual." -- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/nonbinary)
