“GID” is short for “gender identity disorder”. Gender identity disorder was a medical diagnosis given to some people in the past, and appeared in the [ICD 10](http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#!/F64.0). It is now gradually falling out of use.

More modern standards for medical diagnoses use terms like “gender incongruence”.
