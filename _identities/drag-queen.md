title: Drag queen
---

"A man who dresses up in women's clothes, typically for the purposes of entertainment." -- [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/drag_queen)

Drag queens are entertainers who perform in costume and makeup that exaggerates feminine qualities. They adopt a persona which is a woman, but normally are people who identify as a man in everyday life.  

An entertainer who instead exaggerates male qualities is known as a [drag king]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/drag-king.md %}).

Drag exists as part of [ball culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture), a primarily non-white subculture in the US, though drag queens and kings also exist outside of this tradition. People adopting drag queen or drag king identities should be aware of the risk of [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation).
