title: Drag queen
---

"Drag refers to deliberately performing a version of gender that is often hyper-masculine or -feminine; for example, drag kings and drag queens do this. Although drag is often associated with somebody performing the 'opposite' role to their sex assigned at birth, actually anybody can do drag, regardless of their sex/gender." -- [How to Understand Your Gender](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EdspDwAAQBAJ)

A drag queen performs a hyper-feminine gender, usually temporarily as part of a  public performance.  

An entertainer who instead exaggerates masculine qualities is known as a [drag king]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/drag-king.md %}).

Drag exists as part of [ball culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_culture), a primarily non-white subculture in the US, though drag queens and kings also exist outside of this tradition. People adopting drag queen or drag king identities should be aware of the risk of [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation).
