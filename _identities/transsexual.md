"This is a term used by some people who permanently change their bodies, usually, but not always, using hormones or surgery." -- [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32979297)

Transsexual is sometimes abbreviated to "TS".

"The terms 'transsexual' and 'transsexualism' are often considered old-fashioned and stigmatising, and this terminology is increasingly being replaced by terms, such as 'transgender' and 'trans', which many people deem more acceptable." -- [The Transgender Handbook](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ty3fAQAACAAJ)
