Trans is a shortened version of "[transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %})".

Trans is used as an adjective, as in:

- trans person (a person who is trans)
- trans woman (a woman who is trans)
- trans man (a man who is trans)

Some people have adopted the term "[trans*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans-asterisk.md %})" instead. It is normally simpler and less confusing to use the word without an asterisk.

Terms with similar meanings are [trans*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans-asterisk.md %}) and [transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %}).
