Trans is a shortened version of "[transgender]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/transgender.md %})".

Trans is also sometimes used as an adjective, for example trans person (a person who is trans), trans woman (a woman who is trans), or trans man (a man who is trans).

Some people have adopted the term "[trans*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans-asterisk.md %})" instead. It is normally simpler and less confusing to use the word without an asterisk.
