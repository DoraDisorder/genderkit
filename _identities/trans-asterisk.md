Trans* is a term intended to act as a more inclusive version of [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans.md %}), after some people felt that trans was not being used to describe them.

"...for a while a lot of people in trans communities used 'trans*' with the idea that this was a more inclusive term, with the * standing in for various possible endings. But now most agree that 'trans' (without the *) is the more inclusive umbrella term." -- [How to Understand Your Gender](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EdspDwAAQBAJ)

There is a detailed discussion of the history of trans* and the current controversies around its use in [this article by Julia Serano](http://juliaserano.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/regarding-trans-and-transgenderism.html).

It is normally less confusing to use the word [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans.md %}) (without an asterisk).
