title: Trans*
groups: [Umbrella term, Defined by breaking norms]

Trans* is a term intended to act as a more inclusive version of [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans.md %}), after some people felt that trans was not being used to describe them.

There is a detailed discussion of the history of trans* and the current controversies around its use on [Julia Serano's blog](http://juliaserano.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/regarding-trans-and-transgenderism.html).

It is normally less confusing to use the word [trans]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _identities/trans.md %}) (without an asterisk).
