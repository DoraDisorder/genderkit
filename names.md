### Choosing a new name

Choosing a name might be a quick and easy decision or it may take a long time to decide. Take as much time as you need.

Here are some ideas that may help you in choosing a new name:

- *Make a shortlist*

    If you are struggling to think of a name, try compiling a list of names that you like. This could include the names of favourite characters, celebrities, influential figures in your life, or just names you find interesting, attractive, or unique. You might want to add to this list by looking at baby name websites or if you come across a name that you like while out and about in the world.

- *Talk to other people*

    You may want friends or family to have input on your new name. You could organise a group conversation with the people you want to be involved in helping you choose a new name so that you can listen to and discuss all suggestions. However, you get to have the final word on deciding your name!

- *Try some names out*

    If you are considering one or several names but are not sure how they would feel being used for you in practice, you can try using them when ordering at an establishment that calls your name out to give you your order, or asking people you trust around you to try out using that name for you.

- *Use more than one name*

    You may wish to use several different names, either for a short while so that you can decide which one you want to stick with, or on a long-term/permanent basis. While you can legally only have one first name, socially you can use as many as you like. However, it is important to use the same name (including any middle names) across legal documents such as passports and driving licenses, as well as for things such as bank accounts, medical records, and any interactions with government entities (e.g. applying for benefits). This will avoid potential complications around proof of identity. However, some of these may allow you to use a ‘preferred name’ as well as an ‘official name’, in which case you could use two different names.

- *Embrace changing your mind*

    If you decide to use a different name after using one chosen name for a long time, that’s okay! You make the rules about what you want to be called. If you have already changed your name legally once, you can do it again and go through the steps of using your new name as listed below. There is no limit on how many times you can change your name in the UK.

There is no such thing as a bad name! Your name does not have to depend on your age, your appearance, or your gender. Where you got inspiration for your name from, and how popular your name is, does not affect the quality of your name. The one exception to this is names which are commonly associated with an ethnicity or culture which you are not part of.
