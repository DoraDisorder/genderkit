### Choosing a new name

Choosing a new name can be hard and can take time. You might have wanted to change your name to something in particular for years - or maybe you just know that your current name isn't right and that you need a new one.

You can start to narrow things down by thinking about what kind of name you'd like:

- do you want a name that is associated with one *gender*?
- do you want a name that is *popular*, or *rare*?
