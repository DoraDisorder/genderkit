### Words to avoid

Some words are commonly used as a slur - an offensive word used to insult or attack people. Some of these words may be upsetting or traumatic for people, and we strongly suggest you avoid using them. If you want to find out more about these words, you can [read our page about them]({% link slurs.md %}).

There are also words which are specific to a particular culture, such as [two spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit), [hijra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)), or [kathoey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey). Do not use these words to describe yourself unless you are a member of the culture that the word comes from - that would be [cultural appropriation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation). You can read more about these words on [the PBS website](http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/).

People from other cultures may not wish to be described as [transgender]({% link _words/transgender.md %}) or [nonbinary]({% link _words/nonbinary.md %}), because these words use a particular way of thinking about gender specific to [Western culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture). Words like these may not correctly describe who the person is, or how they interact with the society around them.

### What words should I use?

You can use your judgement to choose the most appropriate words to describe yourself. The words you use may vary depending on where you are and who you are describing yourself to.

### Construct your own

You can also create your own words to describe yourself that better fit who you are - even the most commonly used words have only been around a few decades at most, and more are being invented all the time!
