Hysterectomy results in permanent destruction of the uterus (womb) and is irreversible. After hysterectomy you will be unable to become pregnant or give birth.

{% capture warn %}
Not all types of hysterectomy remove the risk of cervical cancer. The cervix is only removed as part of an operation called a "total hysterectomy". Ask your surgeon whether you will still need to be [tested for cervical cancer](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cervical-screening-test/Pages/Introduction.aspx) if you are unsure.

Hysterectomies are usually carried out because of cancer or other tumours of the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes or ovaries. They are also sometimes carried out on people with very heavy periods. 

In the UK, it is recommended that if you have a uterus (womb) and are taking [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) long-term that you have a hysterectomy. This is because testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, which increases risk of cancer {% cite seal:2007 -l 184 %}. Funding for this surgery is normally available on the NHS.

There several types of hysterectomy, which may or may not include removing the cervix or removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (also known as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %})). Hysterectomy does not usually involve removal of the vagina, which is called a [vaginectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}).

You can read more about hysterectomy on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Hysterectomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Costs and funding

The NHS will normally fund total hysterectomy and [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}) for patients who are undergoing [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy.

You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones) {% cite cr161 %}. 

Hysterectomy for other medical reasons is not subject to these requirements.
