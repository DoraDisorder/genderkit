Hysterectomy results in permanent destruction of the uterus (womb) and is irreversible. After hysterectomy you will be unable to become pregnant or give birth.

Not all types of hysterectomy remove the risk of cervical cancer. The cervix is only removed as part of an operation called a "total hysterectomy". Ask your surgeon whether you will still need to be regularly [tested for cervical cancer](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cervical-screening-test/Pages/Introduction.aspx) if you are unsure.

Hysterectomies are usually carried out because of cancer or other tumours of the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes or ovaries. They are also sometimes carried out on people with very heavy periods. 

In the UK, it is recommended that if you have a uterus (womb) and have taken [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) for several years that you have a hysterectomy {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}. 

This is because some studies have suggested testosterone use is linked to endometrial hyperplasia, which can increase risk of endometrial cancer {% cite seal:2007 -l 184 %}. Funding for hysterectomy is normally available on the NHS for people taking testosterone.

There several types of hysterectomy, which may or may not include removing the cervix or removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (also known as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %})). If your hysterectomy does not involve salpingo-oophorectomy, you are still at risk of ovarian cancer.

Hysterectomy does not usually involve removal of the vagina, which is called a [vaginectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}).

Hysterectomy is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend at least 4-6 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer.

You can read more about hysterectomy on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Hysterectomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Costs and funding

The NHS will normally fund total hysterectomy and [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}) for patients who are undergoing [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy.

You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones) {% cite cr181 %}. 

Hysterectomy for other medical reasons is not subject to these requirements.
