Speech and language therapy can be used by people wanting to change the quality of their voice, raise the pitch of their voice, or lower their average pitch. 

A trained speech therapist helps you discover what you would like your voice to sound like and helps you achieve those goals. Speech therapy may be one-on-one, or in a group therapy setting.

Speech therapy cannot normally lower the bottom of the pitch range. Many people are able to accomplish that using [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) instead, though its effects are permanent. (While [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) is able to lower the bottom of the vocal range for many people, [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) has no effect on the voice).

A minority of people are unable to reach their goals through speech and language therapy or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) treatment and undergo surgical interventions to change their voice.

### Costs and funding

Speech and language therapy is often provided free of charge by UK gender identity clinics, with several clinics having their own in-house speech and language therapists. There is a list of NHS speech and language therapists with specialisms in this area based in Wales on [the GPOne website](http://www.gpone.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/documents/1000/Wales%20GI%20Specialist%20SLT%20Contact%20Details%20per%20LHB%20-March%202020.pdf).

The LGBT Foundation in Manchester also run [free introductory workshops](https://lgbt.foundation/who-we-help/trans-people/voice-coaching) for people who identify as trans.

Private speech therapists can charge a variety of different rates, from as low as £50/hour up to over £150/hour. When searching for a speech therapist, you should check they are registered with [HCPC UK](https://www.hcpc-uk.org/) by checking on their website. Checking they are an HCPC member helps make sure that your therapist is properly trained.

You can find a list of speech therapists who have a speciality in helping transgender people on the [Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice website](https://www.helpwithtalking.com/Member-Directory-specialty-23).
