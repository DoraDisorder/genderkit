Speech and language therapy can be used by people wanting to change the quality of their voice, raise the pitch of their voice, or lower their average pitch. 

A trained speech therapist helps you discover what you would like your voice to sound like and helps you achieve those goals. Speech therapy may be one-on-one, or in a group therapy setting.

Speech therapy cannot normally lower the bottom of the pitch range. Many people are able to accomplish that using [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) instead, though its effects are permanent. (While [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) is able to lower the bottom of the vocal range for many people, [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) has no effect on the voice).

Speech and language therapy is often provided free of charge by UK gender identity clinics, with several clinics having their own in-house speech and language therapists. 

Private speech and language therapists who advertise specific experience around gender include:

Speech therapists can charge a variety of different rates, from as low as £50/hour up to over £150/hour.

A minority of people are unable to reach their goals through speech and language therapy or [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) treatment and undergo surgical interventions to change their voice.
