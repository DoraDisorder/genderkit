Always have piercings performed by a professional. **Never** try and pierce yourself. There is a much higher risk of scarring or infection.

Make sure the piercer has a piercing license that is clearly displayed in their establishment. This makes sure that the equipment and facilities being used are safe and hygienic. It is **illegal** to perform piercing without a licence.

Not all jewellery requires piercing to use. Alternatives include clip-on, magnetic, or stick-on earrings, ear cuffs, and 'fake' nose rings. You may want to try these first to find out how you feel about wearing jewellery.

Most parts of the body can be pierced, but not all types of piercings are suitable for everyone. Ask for professional advice if you are considering having your body pierced.

You may want to look for reviews or ask people you know for recommendations of places that will perform piercing.

The time required for a piercing to heal will vary depending on the location of the piercing. A simple ear lobe piercing will normally take 6-8 weeks to heal properly.

Common risks of piercings are infection and scarring. Some types of piercing carry higher risks than others. Other possible complications include migration (where a piercing moves from the place it was originally pierced) and rejection (where the piercing is expelled from the body completely).

While your piercing is healing, keep the area clean and dry, and make sure your hands are clean before you touch the area. It is not normally necessary to rotate or remove a piece of jewellery - try and handle it as little as possible, and touch the jewellery instead of the skin if you can {% cite cieh2013 -l 28 %}.

Public Health England and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health have published advice on how to care for your piercing:

- [mouth and tongue piercing](http://www.cieh.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=47228)
- [body and surface piercing](http://www.cieh.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=47230)
- [vulva piercings](http://www.cieh.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=47232)
- [penis and scrotum piercings](http://www.cieh.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=47234)
- [microdermal implants](http://www.cieh.org/WorkArea/showcontent.aspx?id=47236)

If your piercing becomes infected, you should immediately seek medical attention. Signs of infection are are:

- significant redness around the piercing 
- pus or green or yellow fluid
- bleeding that isn't stopped by light pressure
- an odd smell
- lots of swelling
- a high temperature (fever)
- not wanting to or being able to move arms, legs, fingers, or another part of the body

If you are experiencing these symptoms, immediately seek medical attention {% cite cieh2013 -l 29 %}. If left untreated an infection could lead to abscesses or in more serious cases sepsis (blood poisoning) or toxic shock syndrome.
