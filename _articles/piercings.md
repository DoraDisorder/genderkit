Piercings

Warning: Never try and do piercings yourself. Always seek the advice of a reputable piercer. There isn't a directory, but seek reviews either within your friends or online. Make sure the piercer has a piercing license that is clearly displayed in their establishment and uses proper sterile procedures.

Not everyone will suit or have the right body configuration for all types of piercings. Always seek the advice of your piercer. 

You can pierce most parts of the body, and different places will take longer to heal than others. Some parts of the body are more susceptible to complications than others. The ones that are particularly prone are naval piercings as they're in a warm, sometimes damp location and tongue, because of the bacteria in your mouth. 

Piercings will sometimes migrate or reject. These are two different phenomena despite often being used interchangeably. They can either do so painfully, or sometimes without being noticed at all.

Migration is where a piercing will move from the place it was originally pierced to somewhere else. This happens a lot with things like sub dermal piercings or surface piercings such as eyebrow or naval.

Rejection: this is a cause. This is where the piercing is rejected from the body completely due to it being recognised as a foreign body and then is expelled.


After the piercing, there are two different schools of thought on aftercare. There is the LITHA approach, which is the "Leave It The Hell Alone" approach where you basically just let it heal on it's own and there is the approach where you clean it twice a day with a salt/saline solution. Don't use anything with chemicals in it. Submerge it in a small amount of solution .You can use 1/4 teaspoon of salt per egg cup of water, or you can buy ready made saline solution from the supermarket or from your local opticians although this might be a slightly more expensive of doing it. 

Always wash and dry your hands thoroughly before touching your piercing and don't fiddle with it or turn it.

Check it regularly for signs of infection. Some of these are: 
- pus
- an odd smell
- redness (some is to be expected, you did just have a piece of metal inserted through part of your body!)
- swelling (again, some is to be expected, a lot in some cases)
- itching and burning
- ongoing pain and tenderness
- heat on/around the piercing
- A fever (temperature)

Get medical advice straight away if you think your piercing is infected. You will need antibiotics. If left untreated it could lead to abscesses or in more serious cases sepsis (blood poisoning) or toxic shock syndrome.
