### More information

{% capture warn %}
Taking GnRH agonists without also taking a sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) or inadequate levels of sex hormones can cause osteoporosis or early heart disease {% cite seal2017 %}. If GnRH agonists are being used without an additional sex hormone, [DEXA (bone density) scans](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dexa-scan/) which measure bone mineral density may be needed {% cite murjan2017 -l 197 %}.

GnRH agonists do not provide reliable contraception {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. They do not remove the risk of making someone pregnant, and they do not remove the risk of becoming pregnant.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are medicines that cause the gonads (testes and/or ovaries) to stop producing sex hormones. GnRH agonists are considered to have an excellent side-effect profile with minimal side-effects compared to other alternatives {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap). Certain clinicians also offer Buserelin (Suprecur/Suprefact) and Nafarelin (Synarel).

In people with testes, this produces an anti-androgenic effect (reduction in testosterone levels). GnRH agonists are the main antiandrogen treatment used in the UK as while they are much more expensive than other antiandrogens they have less side effects. As these medications cause an initial rise in testosterone levels for the first few weeks of use, sometimes a short course of [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) will also be given {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

In people with ovaries, treatment with GnRH agonists reduces oestrogen and progesterone levels. This causes periods to stop, along with halting breast growth. They are normally used in the UK to prevent puberty instead of anti-oestrogens like [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}). Treatment with GnRH agonists is not normally necessary for people taking [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) as testosterone normally adequately suppresses production of oestrogen.

People who do not have gonads (ovaries and/or testes) do not need to take GnRH agonists. This means that after [orchidectomy]({% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) or [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), there is no longer any need to use GnRH agonists.

GnRH agonists are usually supplied as injections that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap zoladex1 %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex prostap3 decapeptyl3%}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}. Buserelin and Nafarelin are also available as a nasal spray that is administered twice daily {% cite buserelin nafarelin buserelin-nafarelin-ggp %}.

GnRH agonists may cause erectile dysfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).

### Are there other options?

Alternatives to GnRH agonists include [cyproterone]({% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}), [spironolactone]({% link _articles/spironolactone.md %}), and [anastrozole]({% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}). While these options are generally cheaper, GnRH agonists are generally preferred by NHS clinicians due to a much lower risk of side effects {% cite seal2017 %}.
