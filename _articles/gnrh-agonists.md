{% capture warn %}
Taking GnRH agonists without also taking a sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) can cause osteoporosis or endometriosis.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are medicines that cause the gonads (testes and/or ovaries) to stop producing sex hormones after a few weeks, and with continued use cause a sustained supression of sex hormone production.

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap).

In people with testes, this produces an anti-androgenic effect (reduction in testosterone levels). GnRH agonists are more expensive than other antiandrogens, but often have less side effects, so are the common used antiandrogen in the UK. As these medications cause an initial rise in testosterone levels for the first few weeks of use, sometimes a short course of [cyproterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) will also be given {% cite seal:2007 --location 170 %}.

In people with ovaries, treatment with GnRH agonists reduces oestrogen and progesterone levels. This causes periods to stop, along with halting breast growth.

People who do not have gonads (ovaries and/or testes) do not need to take GnRH agonists (for example, after [orchidectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) or [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}) there is no longer any need to use GnRH agonists).

GnRH agonists are usually supplied in forms that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex %}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}.

GnRH treatment is available to people with testes who have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) of gender dysphoria for free on the NHS. It is also used by the NHS to prevent puberty in under 18s, and sometimes in conjunction with testosterone treatment to suppress menses {% cite ngicns-endocrine --location 5 %}.

GnRH agonists may cause erectile disfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
