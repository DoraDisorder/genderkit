{% capture warn %}
Taking GnRH agonists without also taking a sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) or inadequate levels of sex hormones can cause osteoporosis or early heart disease {% cite seal2017 %}. If GnRH agonists are being used without an additional sex hormone, DEXA (bone density) scans which measure bone mineral density may be needed {% cite murjan2017 -l 197 %}.

GnRH agonists do not provide reliable contraception {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. They do not remove the risk of making someone pregnant, and they do not remove the risk of becoming pregnant.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are medicines that cause the gonads (testes and/or ovaries) to stop producing sex hormones. GnRH agonists are considered to have an excellent side-effect profile with minimal side-effects compared to other alternatives {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap).

In people with testes, this produces an anti-androgenic effect (reduction in testosterone levels). GnRH agonists are the main antiandrogen treatment used in the UK as while they are much more expensive than other antiandrogens they have less side effects. As these medications cause an initial rise in testosterone levels for the first few weeks of use, sometimes a short course of [cyproterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/cyproterone.md %}) will also be given {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

In people with ovaries, treatment with GnRH agonists reduces oestrogen and progesterone levels. This causes periods to stop, along with halting breast growth. They are normally used in the UK to prevent puberty instead of anti-oestrogens like [anastrozole]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/anastrozole.md %}). Treatment with GnRH agonists is not normally necessary for people taking [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) as testosterone normally adequately suppresses production of oestrogen.

People who do not have gonads (ovaries and/or testes) do not need to take GnRH agonists. This means that after [orchidectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}) or [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), there is no longer any need to use GnRH agonists.

GnRH agonists are usually supplied in forms that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex %}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}.

GnRH agonists may cause erectile dysfunction in people with penises. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).

### Costs and funding

GnRH treatment is available to people with testes who have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) on the NHS. It is also used by the NHS to prevent puberty in under 18s, and sometimes in conjunction with testosterone treatment to stop menstruation (periods) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %}.

You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland]( https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
