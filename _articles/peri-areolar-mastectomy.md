Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the [double incision mastectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}) technique. However, some people may be able to undergo peri-areolar mastectomy instead.

Peri-areolar mastectomy is usually used only to remove small breasts (B-cup or less) where the patient also has good skin elasticity. 

Unlike double incision mastectomy, peri-areolar mastectomy results in significantly less visible scarring, but may also cause over-reduction of the breast leaving a depression or dip in the chest. Repositioning of nipples cannot be carried out during peri-areolar mastecomy without leaving very conspicious scarring, unlike double incision mastectomy {% cite seal:2007 -l 227 %}.

You can read more about mastectomy on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastectomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Cost and funding

The cost of privately obtaining a mastectomy in the UK is around Â£TODO.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy. Mastectomy for reasons of gender dysphoria requires a written letter of recommendation from a specialist gender clinician (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery {% cite cr161 %}.
