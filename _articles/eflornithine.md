Eflornithine inhibits an enzyme (ornithine decarboxylase) that is part of the process of hair growth {% cite seal:2007 --locator 165 %}. 

It is a cream, applied to an area of the body twice a day, at least eight hours apart. Eflornithine takes up to eight weeks to work, and the original rate of hair growth resumes within eight weeks of stopping eflornithine. 

Eflornithine is not suitable for under 18s or people who are pregnant. It is only available in the UK by prescription. {% cite vaniqua %}.
