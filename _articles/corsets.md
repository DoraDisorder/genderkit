### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
There is little or no medical research into the health effects of wearing corsets. A literature search by Gender Construction Kit found only one medical study {% cite gau1998corsets %}. The long term health risks are entirely unknown.

There is a lot of conflicting information out there about the health risks of corsets.

Wearing a corset loosely for fashion purposes is likely to be safe. However, tightly lacing the corset to reduce your waist size carries unknown health risks. In particular, the effects on young people whose bones are still developing has not been studied.

As with other tight-fitting clothing such as [binders]({% link _articles/binding.md %}), you may be able to reduce the risk by limiting the amount of time you wear a corset, taking "rest days" where you do not wear the corset, and removing the corset as soon as possible if you notice any pain. However, there is no real evidence out there showing how effective these techniques will be at reducing the risk.
