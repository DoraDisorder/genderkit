Cyproterone can cause liver malfunction and depression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170,174 %} and higher doses have been linked to meningioma {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}.

Prolonged treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage. Cyproterone does not effectively remove the risk of pregnancy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %} and should not be used as a contraceptive method.

{% capture warn %}
Taking cyproterone without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.

Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) is a drug that reduces the amount that the body reacts to testosterone. It also reduces levels of the hormones that cause the body to produce testosterone {% cite seal2017 -l 235 %}.

In the UK GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) agonists are generally prescribed instead, as they cause fewer side effects. These are described in more detail on the [GnRH agonists page]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}).

In some cases, a short course of cyproterone is used in patients with testes receiving treatment with GnRH agonists to reduce the effects of the initial spike in testosterone levels caused by these medications {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

Cyproterone may cause erectile dysfunction. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
