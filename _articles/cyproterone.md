### How do I stay safe?

{% capture warn %}
Taking cyproterone without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) can cause osteoporosis.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

If you're taking cyproterone, you should also take at least a small dose of one of oestrogen or testosterone, to avoid osteoporosis. As with all hormones and hormone blockers, regular blood tests and monitoring are essential to spot any problems that arise.

{% capture warn %}
Cyproterone has been linked to meningioma {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}. Do not take cyproterone if you have a meningioma or a history of meningioma.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Meningioma is a type of intracranial tumour, a tumour that forms in the membranous layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. These are usually benign, but can cause a variety of problems due to the pressure they put on the structures of the brain and nervous system. The risk of meningioma linked to cyproterone is low, but increases with cumulative dose, meaning that the more cyproterone you have taken over the course of your life, the higher the risk.

Current government advice {% cite gov-cyproterone %} states that you should not take cyproterone if you have a meningioma or a history of meningioma, and you should be vigilant for symptoms of meningioma, which are:
- Changes in vision
- Hearing loss or ringing in the ears
- Loss of smell
- Headaches that worsen with time
- Memory loss
- Seizures
- Weakness in extremities

However, just because you do not have any of these symptoms does not mean you don't have a meningioma. If you are worried that you might have a meningioma, talk to your doctor.

### What should I be aware of?

{% capture warn %}
Cyproterone can cause liver malfunction and depression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170,174 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Prolonged treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage. Cyproterone does not effectively remove the risk of pregnancy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %} and should not be used as a contraceptive method.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Cyproterone may cause erectile dysfunction. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).

### Are there other options?

In the UK GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) agonists are generally prescribed instead, as they cause fewer side effects. These are described in more detail on [the GnRH agonists page]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}). In some cases, a short course of cyproterone is used in patients with testes receiving treatment with GnRH agonists to reduce the effects of the initial spike in testosterone levels caused by these medications {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}.

### How does it work?

Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) is a drug that reduces the amount that the body reacts to testosterone. It also reduces levels of the hormones that cause the body to produce testosterone {% cite seal2017 -l 235 %}.
