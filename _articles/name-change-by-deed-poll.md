Once you have changed your name, you will need to update your details with lots of different organisations. You can find out who you need to notify and how to do it on our page about [telling organisations]({% link _articles/telling-organisations.md %}).

You can also choose to officially [register your name change by deed poll]({% link _articles/registering-a-name-change.md %}), but most people do not do this.

### Where can I learn more?

You can find more information about changing your name by deed poll on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview).

### How much will it cost?

Some companies offer paid services for "official" deed polls: these "official" deed polls are no more legal {% cite vincent2018transgender -l 71 %} than one you have printed yourself using [the template on the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll) or the [Free UK Deed Poll website](https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/). There is no need to pay an organisation for a deed poll (see [this Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/29/deed-poll-websites-avoid) for more information).

### Signatories

To change your name by deed poll, you will need to obtain the signatures of two independent witnesses to your deed poll. These need to be people who know you personally but who are not part of your family. 

If you are unable to do this, you may wish to use a [name change by statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}). A statutory declaration must be witnessed by a solicitor, which will involve paying a small fee.
