To change your name by deed poll, you will need to obtain the signatures of two independent witnesses to your deed poll. If you are unable to do this, you may wish to try a [name change by statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}), which is witnessed by a solicitor instead.

While some companies offer paid services for deed polls, it is possible to change your name by deed poll for free, unlike a  [name change by statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}).

Once you have changed your name, you will need to update your details with lots of different organisations. You can find out who you need to notify and how to do it on our page about [telling organisations]({% link _articles/telling-organisations.md %}).

You can find more information about changing your name by deed poll on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/overview).
