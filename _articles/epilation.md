Epilation involves pain and discomfort, unlike [shaving]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/shaving.md %}), but removes the whole hair including the root. This means that the hair takes longer to grow back.

For individual hairs, you may want to use tweezers to [pluck]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/plucking.md %}) them individually.

Epilators come in a range of prices, from £20 up to over £200.
