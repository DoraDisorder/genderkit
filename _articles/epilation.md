Epilation involves pain and discomfort, unlike [shaving]({% link _articles/shaving.md %}), but removes the whole hair including the root. This means that the hair takes longer to grow back.

If there are only a few hairs on an area of skin, you may want to use tweezers to [pluck]({% link _articles/plucking.md %}) them individually instead.

Epilators come in a range of prices, from £20 up to over £200.
