### More information

In this procedure, the skin is exposed to pulses of laser light. The laser is of a specific wavelength that heats up the hair, causing the hair and hair follicle to be heated and destroyed, stopping that hair from regrowing. It is unable to remove hairs that are not dark, such as ginger, grey, or blonde hairs. These hairs are usually removed by [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}) instead. Electrolysis may be up to 60 times slower and more painful {% cite gorgu2000comparison %}.

Laser hair reduction can be carried out using several different types of laser with different wavelengths: ruby (694nm), alexandrite (755nm), diode (810nm), and Nd:YAG (1,064-nm). Diode and alexandrite lasers are most effective for hair reduction, but only work effectively on pale skin. For people with darker coloured skin, Nd:YAG is more effective {% cite sadighha2009meta lapidoth2010best %}. Your laser technician should be able to discuss with you the type of laser they have available and whether it will be suitable for you.

Common side effects of laser hair reduction are erythema (skin redness) and edema (swelling) for up to 48 hours. Patients who undergo laser hair reduction may also experience temporary hypopigmentation (paleness in the treated area) (14–25%) or hyperpigmentation (darkened skin in the treated area) (10–17%). If the laser is not properly configured for the patient, another possible side effect is increased hair growth {% cite lapidoth2010best %}.

Laser hair reduction may be painful or uncomfortable. You can reduce the discomfort by asking your GP to prescribe you lidocaine and prilocaine cream, also known as EMLA cream. This is a local anaesthetic, applied directly onto the skin, which numbs the skin so you feel less pain from the treatment. You will normally need to apply the cream around an hour before your treatment.

### Are there other options?

A similar treatment is [IPL]({% link _articles/ipl.md %}).

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about laser hair removal on the [NHS website](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/laser-hair-removal.aspx).

### How much will it cost?

The price of laser hair reduction varies depending on the size of the area to be treated. A common area is the face and neck, which would normally cost around £100-200 per session. NHS Scotland have produced guidance that suggests that around 15 sessions of 30 minutes each would normally be needed to clear facial hair growth {% cite ngicns2020facial -l 6 %}.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) and unwanted facial hair, the NHS may provide funding for some laser hair reduction or [electrolysis]({% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}):

- *NHS England*: up to 8 sessions of laser hair removal {% cite specEngNonsurgical -l 17 %}
- *NHS Scotland*: a minimum of 15 sessions of laser hair removal {% cite ngicns2020facial -l 10 %}
- *NHS Wales*: facial hair removal is not currently funded by NHS Wales {% cite specWalesNonsurgical -l 40 %}

The NHS will normally fund genital hair removal before [vaginoplasty]({% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}) surgery or hair removal for donor skin sites for [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}) surgery if urethroplasty is to be performed.

Remember to check the official inspection reports for your laser clinic before you attend to check that that their staff are properly trained and work safely:

- in Wales, you can read the reports on the [Healthcare in Wales website](http://hiw.org.uk/find-service/?lang=en)
- in Northern Ireland, you can read the reports on the [Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority website](https://rqia.org.uk/inspections/view-inspections-as/map/?listing=1)
- in England, unfortunately reports are not available for all clinics, but some can be found by typing in the search box on the [Care Quality Commission website](https://www.cqc.org.uk)
- in Scotland, unfortunately reports are not available for all clinics, but some can be found by typing in the search box on the [Healthcare Improvement Scotland website](http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/our_work/inspecting_and_regulating_care/independent_healthcare/find_a_provider_or_service.aspx)

You can find more information about choosing who will do your procedure on [the NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/choosing-who-will-do-your-procedure/). You may also may want to ask a [local group]({% link _resources/local.md %}) for people changing things related to gender to find out if people have had any problems with the clinic.
