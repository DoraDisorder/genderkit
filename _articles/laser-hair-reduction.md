In this procedure, the skin is exposed to pulses of laser light. The laser is of a specific wavelength that heats up the hair, causing the hair and hair follicle to be heated and destroyed, stopping that hair from regrowing. It is unable to remove hairs that are not dark, such as ginger, grey, or blonde hairs. It works most effectively on pale skin, though some newer machines work much more effectively on dark coloured skin.

Laser hair reduction may be painful or uncomfortable. You can reduce the discomfort by asking your GP to prescribe you lidocaine and prilocaine cream, also known as EMLA cream. This is a local anaesthetic, applied directly onto the skin, which numbs the skin so you feel less pain from the treatment. You will normally need to apply the cream around an hour before your treatment.

The price of laser hair reduction varies depending on the size of the area to be treated. A common area is the face and neck, which would normally cost around Â£100-200 per session. If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria and unwanted facial hair, the NHS may provide funding for some laser hair reduction or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}).

The NHS will normally fund genital hair removal before [vaginoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}) surgery or hair removal for donor skin sites for [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}) surgery if urethroplasty is to be performed.
