In this procedure, the skin is exposed to pulses of laser light. The laser is of a specific wavelength that heats up the hair, causing the hair and hair follicle to be heated and destroyed, stopping that hair from regrowing. It is unable to remove hairs that are not dark, such as ginger, grey, or blonde hairs. It works most effectively on pale skin, though some newer machines work much more effectively on dark coloured skin.

The price of laser hair reduction varies depending on the size of the area to be treated. A common area is the face and neck, which would normally cost around Â£100-200. If you have a [formal diagnosis] of gender dysphoria, the NHS may provide funding for some laser hair reduction or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}).
