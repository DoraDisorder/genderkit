### More information

Minoxidil comes as a liquid or foam that is applied to the scalp to slow hair loss. It is used to treat hair loss caused by testosterone.

A commonly used alternative to minoxidil is [finasteride]({% link _articles/finasteride.md %}). Unlike minoxidil, finasteride is only available on prescription.

Minoxidil may take several months to start taking effect, and there may be an initial loss of hair in the first few weeks.

Minoxidil is not suitable for people who are sunburned or who have psoriasis or hypertension, as well as people taking certain medications. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist about whether Minoxidil is suitable for you {% cite minoxidil %}.

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about hair loss treatments at the [NHS website](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Hair-loss/Pages/Treatment.aspx).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of Minoxidil is around Â£10-20 per month, with cost varying depending on the quantity bought at a time. You can buy it from a pharmacy or high-street chemist.

Minoxidil is not normally funded by the NHS.
