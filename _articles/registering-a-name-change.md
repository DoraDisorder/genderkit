### Why might I want to register a name change?

If you were born or adopted in Scotland, registering a change of name will allow you to request an updated birth certificate with a new name. This only updates the birth certificate itself, and you can use a new name in Scotland without having updated your birth certificate. Registering a change of name does not allow you to update the gender recorded on your birth certificate, which is instead changed by [obtaining a GRC]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}).

### Why might I not want to register a name change?

As registering a name change causes information about your name change to become publicly available, most people do not decide to register their change of name, and you are not required to do so.

### How do I register a name change?

If you want to officially register your change of name:

- in *England and Wales*, you can find information about enrolling a deed poll on [the GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/enrol-a-deed-poll-with-the-courts).
- in *Scotland*, you can find information about registering your name change on [the National Records of Scotland website](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/recording-change-of-forename-and-surname-in-scotland).
- in *Northern Ireland*, you can find information about recording a change of name on [the NI Direct website](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/recording-change-name).

### How much will it cost?

The cost of enrolling a deed poll varies between nations, but is normally around Â£30-40.
