There are several reasons you might want to consider regular exercise:

- *mood and health* - to improve physical fitness but also to improve mental health and mood
- *weight loss* - to reduce chest, hip or buttock size, to make muscles more defined, or to prepare for medical procedures. A number of UK surgeons who perform gender related surgeries require people to have a body mass index (BMI) below a certain threshold before they will operate. 
- *changing body shape* - to change the size of shoulders, arms, chest, thighs, or buttocks by developing muscle.

**Mood and health** 

It is now widely recognised that there is good evidence that regular exercise has beneficial effects on mental health {% cite stathopoulou2006exercise %}. (You can [read more about this from the NHS](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/mental-benefits-of-exercise.aspx)).

The Chief Medical Officers of England, Scotland, Wales and NI have [recommended](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216370/dh_128210.pdf) that adults (19-64 years old) should perform either:

- 150 minutes of "moderate" intensity activity each week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more
- 75 minutes of "vigorous" intensity activity spread across the week or combinations of moderate and vigorous intensity activity

One way to do this is brisk walking or cycling for 30 minutes on at least 5 days a week. For example, a 15 minute walk to work or education in the morning and a 15 minute walk back each weekday.

Exercise can be intimidating at first, as sport and fitness activities can be very segregated based on gender. However, the situation is improving!

Many swimming pools and gyms now have cubicle based changing rooms and showers which may be more comfortable for you. You may want to research your local fitness facilities to find out if there are any with these kinds of facilities.

Swimming can be particularly difficult for many people as it can involve very tight clothing that can make the shape of your chest or crotch visible. If you find your chest shape distresses you, most pools will be happy for you to wear a rash vest, which can help to hide your chest shape. If your crotch causes you distress, you may be able to find "swim skirt" swimwear that hides your crotch shape, or wear loose "board shorts" style swimming trunks.

In some areas of the country there are organisations specifically for expanding access to sport and fitness for people regardless of their gender history. Some run regular sessions at swimming pools where transgender, nonbinary or gender variant people can attend as a group. Try looking at the "Sport and fitness" tag on our [UK Organisations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link organisations.md %}) index for organisations near you.

You can read more about the benefits of regular exercise and get advice on what you can do next on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/fitness/Pages/Fitnesshome.aspx).

**Weight loss** can be confusing because there are many different types diets promoted by many different organisations. 

While there are many diets that suggest changing the amount of carbohydrate ("carbs"), protein, or fat in your diet or cutting out certain foods, there currently isn't any clear medical evidence for any of these diets being better than just reducing calories {% cite sacks2009comparison %}. Given this, the current recommendations in the UK {% cite nice-obesity %} and elsewhere {% cite jensen20142013 %} are to reduce your calorie intake while ensuring you are doing regular exercise.

Do not attempt to radically reduce calories by eating very small amounts unless you have been told to do so by a doctor.

So that you are confident that your hard work will be successful, you may wish to use the diet recommended by the NHS and the British Dietic Association and available on [the NHS website](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/weight-loss-guide/Pages/losing-weight-getting-started.aspx).

It is worth talking to your GP about weight loss, as they may be able to refer you to local NHS services for managing weight loss and your lifestyle.

**Changing body shape** 

You may also want to use exercise as part of a strategy to change your body shape by increasing muscle mass in certain areas of your body (shoulders, arms, chest, thighs, or buttocks). Doing this requires exercising specific muscle groups.

You will find that which sex hormones you have in your body will significantly affect your upper body strength and how easy it is for you to increase muscle mass. [Testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy increases the ability to increase muscle mass, while reduction of testosterone can cause significant loss of strength.

A personal trainer can help you to safely and effectively reach your goals for your body by providing support and recommending activities.

If you are based in London, there are some personal trainers specifically catering to transgender clients:

- [Pete Griggs](http://www.petegriggs.com/personal-trainer-transgender/) offers a personal training service for transgender people
- [Becca Knapp](http://www.trainwithbecca.com/) is a personal trainer advertising queer and transgender friendly services

There is more information on finding a properly qualified and insured personal trainer on [the National Register of Personal Trainers website](http://www.nrpt.co.uk/find/index.htm).
