Tucking involves pulling the penis backwards between your legs. Usually, the testes (testicles) are also moved forwards. Many people are able to partly or completely insert the testes into the entrances to the inguinal canals to further hide them.

To keep the genitals held in this position, one or both of the following are normally used:

- *tight underwear or shorts*: look for stretchy fabric containing elastane, which is sometimes known as Lycra. You should be able to find this kind of clothing described as "shapewear", "control pants" or "control knickers" in most shops that sell underwear, or you can try using cycling shorts or swimwear.
- *medical tape*: this usually requires shaving the area to be comfortable.

If you have difficulty with this, you can also purchase a specialised item of clothing called a "gaff", designed specifically to hold the penis in place.

Possible side effects of tucking are:

- skin irritation and [fungal infections](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Ringworm/Pages/Introduction.aspx), particularly if tape is being used {% cite conard2017supporting %}
- defects or hernias at the external inguinal ring {% cite feldman2006transgender -l 7 %}
- infections such as epididymoorchitis,
prostatitis, or cystitis {% cite deutsch2016guidelines -l 93 %}
- chronic pain in the testes {% cite deutsch2016guidelines -l 93 %}

We are not aware of any research into how common these side effects are.
