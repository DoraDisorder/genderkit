Tucking involves placing the penis between your legs. Usually, the testes (testicles) are also moved forwards. Many people are able to insert the testes into the entrances to the inguinal canals.

To keep the genitals held in this position, one or more of the following are normally used:

- very tight underwear
- tight shorts (look for stretchy fabric containing elastane, which is sometimes known as Lycra)
- medical tape (this usually requires shaving the area to be comfortable)

If you have difficulty with this, you can also purchase a specialised item of clothing called a "gaff", designed specifically to hold the penis in place.

Possible side effects of tucking are:

- skin irritation and fungal infections, particularly if tape is being used {% cite conard2017supporting %}
- defects or hernias at the external inguinal ring {% cite feldman2006transgender -l 7 %}
