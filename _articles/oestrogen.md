{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease (problems caused by blood clotting like deep vein thrombosis), prolactinomas, gallstones, and liver problems. These risks can be reduced by regular blood testing, stopping smoking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle {% cite seal2017 %}.

{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen causes development of breast tissue, and all people who have taken oestrogen should be aware that they are at risk of breast cancer. There is no recommended method for breast self-examination in the UK, but you should learn how your breast tissue feels and looks and see a doctor if you experience any unexpected changes.

Oestrogen is commonly available in oral (pill or tablet) form, transdermal patches (patches that are stuck to the skin), gels applied to the skin, and as depot injections or implants {% cite seal2017 -l 237 %}.

There are several different variants of oestrogen available: normally valerate or hemihydrate in the UK, and sometimes cypionate or bezoate are used (which have a longer lasting effect). In the past ethinylestradiol and conjugated equine oestrogens were used, but these are now avoided because they have a much higher risk of blood clots {% cite toorians2003venous %} and are also not detectable in normal blood tests.

Oestrogen can cause an increase in size of hips and buttocks by causing an increase in skin fat deposits around these areas {% cite seal2017 %}, but this may take up to five years to take place {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}. Oestrogen does not change the shape of the pelvis (hip bones) in adults.

Oestrogen may also have positive effects on mood for many people, with many transgender women using oestrogen reporting a calmer mood {% cite seal2017 %}.

In combination with oestrogen therapy most people will also wish for testosterone to be reduced. Antiandrogens (in the UK, normally [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %})) are the most common approach for testosterone suppression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}, though some endocrinologists may use high doses of oestrogen for testosterone suppression instead where possible {% cite pg12 -l 12 %}. If this is performed, the side effects of testosterone reduction can include genital shrinkage and temporary or permanent infertility.

### Costs and funding

If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide oestrogen therapy and treatment with GnRH agonists. 

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. If your GP agrees, the cost of your medication is funded by the NHS. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.

For oestrogen therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

Oestrogen therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when oestrogen therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide oestrogen to selected 16 and 17 year olds {% cite gids2016 %}.
