Taking oestrogen may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease (problems caused by blood clotting like [deep vein thrombosis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx)), prolactinoma, [gallstones](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Gallstones/Pages/Introduction.aspx), and liver problems. These risks can be reduced by regular blood testing, stopping smoking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle {% cite seal2017 %}.

{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen causes development of breast tissue, and all people who have taken oestrogen should be aware that they are at risk of breast cancer. There is no recommended method for breast self-examination in the UK, but you should learn how your breast tissue feels and looks and see a doctor if you experience any unexpected changes.

While oestrogen does reduce production of sperm, it does not provide adequate contraception protection {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. It does not prevent pregnancy effectively.

Oestrogen is commonly available in oral (pill or tablet) form, transdermal patches (patches that are stuck to the skin), gels applied to the skin, and as depot injections or implants {% cite seal2017 -l 237 %}.

There are several different variants of oestrogen available. In the UK, oestrodiol valerate or oestrodiol hemihydrate are normally used, but cypionate or bezoate are also available and have a longer lasting effect. In the past, ethinylestradiol and conjugated equine oestrogens were used, but these are now avoided because they have a much higher risk of blood clots {% cite toorians2003venous %} and are not detectable in normal blood tests.

Oestrogen can cause an increase in size of hips and buttocks by enlarging skin fat deposits around these areas {% cite seal2017 %}, but this may take up to five years {% cite hembree2009endocrine %}. Oestrogen does not change the shape of the pelvis (hip bones) in adults.

Oestrogen may have positive effects on your mood. Many transgender women taking oestrogen reporting a calmer mood {% cite seal2017 %}.

In combination with oestrogen therapy most people will also wish for testosterone to be reduced. Antiandrogens (in the UK, normally [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %})) are the most common approach for testosterone suppression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}, though some endocrinologists may use high doses of oestrogen for testosterone suppression instead where possible {% cite pg12 -l 12 %}. If this is performed, the side effects of testosterone reduction can include genital shrinkage and temporary or permanent infertility.

For oestrogen therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

### Costs and funding

If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide oestrogen therapy and treatment with GnRH agonists. Oestrogen therapy is not usually provided to under-18s on the NHS, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when oestrogen therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide oestrogen to selected 16 and 17 year old people {% cite gids2016 %}.

You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland]( https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
