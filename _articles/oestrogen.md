{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease (problems caused by blood clotting). This includes a higher risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) {% cite seal:2007 -l 175 %}. Where possible, oestrogen should be taken under medical supervision with regular blood testing.

{% capture warn %}
Taking oestrogen causes development of breast tissue, and all people who have taken oestrogen should be aware that they are at risk of breast cancer. There is no recommended method for breast self-examination in the UK, but you should learn how your breast tissue feels and looks and see a doctor if you experience any unexpected changes.

Oestrogen is commonly available in oral (pill) form, transdermal patches (patches that are stuck to the skin), gels applied to the skin, and as depot injections.

There are several different variants of oestrogen available: normally valerate or hemihydrate in the UK, and sometimes cypionate or bezoate are used (which have a longer lasting effect). In the past ethinylestradiol and conjugated equine oestrogens were used, but these are now avoided because they have a much higher risk of blood clots {% cite toorians2003venous %} and are also not detectable in normal blood tests.

If you have recieved a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide oestrogen therapy.

For oestrogen therapy to begin, it is required that any other signficant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

In combination with oestrogen therapy most people will also wish for testosterone to be reduced. Antiandrogens (in the UK, normally [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %})) are the most common approach for testosterone supression {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}, though some endocrinologists may use high doses of oestrogen for testosterone suppression instead where possible {% cite pg12 -l 12 %}.

Oestrogen therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when oestrogen therapy can be commenced.
