Permanent eyelash curling is performed in a beauty salon. A beautician applies a gel to the eyebrows which contains chemicals which are used to curl the eyelashes.

There are currently no national standards for beauty salons, and anyone can legally start a salon in most parts of the country. However, many salons have voluntarily joined professional organisations that maintain registers of beauticians who have a minimum level of educational qualifications to be able to provide safe and hygienic treatment. 

You can search for salons on the [British Association of Beauty Therapy & Cosmetology (BABTAC) database](https://www.babtac.com/salons), or look whether the salon advertises membership of professional organisations such as the [Health and Beauty Industry Authority](https://www.habia.org/) or the [British Association of Cosmetic Nurses](https://www.bacn.org.uk/).
