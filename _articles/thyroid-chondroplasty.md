Thyroid chondroplasty involves removing some of the cartilage at the front of the Adam's apple to flatten it, making it less visible.

Thyroid chondroplasty is often carried out during surgeries that affect the voice - either to reduce the number of operations required, or because those surgeries would otherwise make the Adam's apple more apparent.

A number of variations on the basic surgical technique exist, including incision directly over the cartilage (generally less preferable as it leaves more visible scars), incision through the submental area (directly below the chin), and endoscopic surgeries {% cite morrison2016facial %}. The surgeon can also use an endoscope to pinpoint the location of the vocal chords to avoid damage {% cite spiegel2008chondrolaryngoplasty %}.

Possible complications of thyroid chondroplasty include not enough cartilage being removed, damage to the vocal cords, and destabilization of the epiglottis {% cite morrison2016facial %}.
