{% capture warn %}
Any current visa you hold will not be transferred to your new passport. Some countries will allow you to travel with both your new valid passport and your old invalidated passport, but this will out you every time that you need to show your visa. Other countries will require you to have the visa transferred or possibly even apply for a new visa. You are advised to check with any country you hold a visa with before you update your details.

Updating a passport is different depending on whether you already have a UK passport or not.

### I already have an existing UK passport

You can update your name and/or gender marker on an existing UK passport either [online](https://www.gov.uk/apply-renew-passport) or by post. Forms for postal updates are available from your local post office. You will need to return your old passport along with the application. If you have lost your passport, you will need to declare it lost. 

To update your name on your passport you will need to send your [deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}). Photocopies are not accepted, so you must either send the original document or a [certified copy](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document).  

To update your gender marker on an existing passport you will also need either:

- a letter from a doctor (normally either your gender specialist or your GP) saying that they consider this change to be permanent. Your GP will usually  charge you money for writing this letter.
- or a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}). 

A GRC is *not* required to update your passport if you have a letter from a specialist or GP.

### I don't have an existing UK passport

If you already have a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}) or an updated birth certificate, you can apply for a passport as normal with your updated birth or adoption certificate. Name change documents and letters from doctors are not required.

If you *do not* have a [gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}) and updated birth certificate, you will need to fill in the application for a new passport, and include your existing birth or adoption certificate along with the documents listed above.

### More information

Regardless of whether you have an existing UK passport, you will need to send the passport office two [passport photographs](https://www.gov.uk/photos-for-passports). If your appearance has changed significantly, or this is your first passport, you will also need to get the photographs [countersigned](https://www.gov.uk/countersigning-passport-applications). If you are in doubt, it can be better to get them countersigned, as having to respond to a request to send in new photographs can slow the process down. 

### Where can I learn more?

You can read more about obtaining or renewing passports on the [HM Passport Office website](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/251703/Applying_for_a_passport_additional_information.PDF).
