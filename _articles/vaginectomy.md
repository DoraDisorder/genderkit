Vaginectomy is surgery to remove the vaginal canal. This does not remove the uterus (womb) or ovaries, which are removed by [salpingo-oophorectomy]({% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}) and [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}).

There are two types of vaginectomy:

- *total vaginectomy:* this operation involves complete removal of all the tissue of the vagina and is considered risky. This operation is normally only used to remove cancer.
- *mucosal vaginectomy:* this operation involves removing some of the lining of the vagina and then closing the entrance up. The inside of the vagina then collapses in on itself. This is significantly safer, though there may be some significant loss of sexual sensation after this operation {% cite ralph:2007 -l 243 %}. You must have a [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) in order for vaginectomy to be possible. It is possible to close the external outer opening of the vulva as part of this operation {% cite christopher2017 -l 292 %}. 

### Preparing for a surgical procedure

Doing some preparation in advance can help make sure everything goes smoothly during your hospital stay and recovery. To help you avoid forgetting to do or buy something we have created a [Getting ready for gender surgeries page]({% link surgery-checklist.md %}).
