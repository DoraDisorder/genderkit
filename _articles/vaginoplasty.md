After vaginoplasty, regular dilation must be carried out in order to maintain the shape of the vagina. Failure to regularly dilate can result in prolapse, serious health complications and/or permanent loss of the vagina.

Vaginoplasty involves surgically constructing a neovagina (artificially created vagina), normally out of tissue taken from the penis and/or scrotum. The penis is completely destroyed in the process.

Vaginoplasty only creates the vaginal canal (the internal tube). The vulva (external part of the genitalia) is created by [labiaplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}) and [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}). These operations are usually carried out together with vaginoplasty.

Vaginoplasty does not give the ability to menstruate (have periods) or to become pregnant or give birth.

Vaginoplasty is a major surgery, with serious risks including deep vein thrombosis, prolapse of the neovagina, weakness of the rectal wall, and urethral stenosis (blockage of the urethra resulting in inability to pass urine) {% cite bellringer:2007 -l 215 %}.

A very common but much less serious side effect is *granulation tissue* forming inside the neovagina, which is treated by treatment with silver nitrate. This can often be carried out by a GP or practice nurse.

UK surgeons will normally expect that your BMI is below 30 before carrying out vaginoplasty.

Vaginoplasty is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend around 10 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer.

For some people, vaginoplasty can provide a significant improvement in mental health. There is overall agreement in medical studies that after gender confirming medical interventions, rates of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric symptoms reduce considerably {% cite arcelus2017 -l 181 %}. However, as with other major life changes, you may find that [counselling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/counselling.md %}) before and after surgery may be helpful.

### Cost and funding

A operation in the UK to perform vaginoplasty along with [labiaplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}) and [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) costs around £11-12000.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for vaginoplasty and [penectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/penectomy.md %}), [orchidectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}), [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) and/or [labiaplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.

The NHS will normally also fund hair removal from the genitals before vaginoplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}). This is to ensure that hair does not grow in the vagina. The process of hair removal may take many months {% cite bellringer:2007 -l 217 %}. Not all patients require hair removal, and your surgeon should tell you whether you need to do this or not.
