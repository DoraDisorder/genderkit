{% capture warn %}
After vaginoplasty, regular dilation must be carried out in order to maintain the shape of the vagina. Failure to regularly dilate can result in prolapse, serious health complications and/or permanent loss of the vagina.

Vaginoplasty involves surgically constructing a neovagina (artifically created vagina), normally out of tissue taken from the penis and/or scrotum. The penis is completely destroyed in the process.

Vaginoplasty only creates the vaginal canal (the internal tube). The vulva (external part of the genitalia) is created by [labioplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/labioplasty.md %}) and [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}). These operations are usually carried out together with vaginoplasty.

Vaginoplasty is a major surgery, with serious risks including deep vein thrombosis, prolapse of the neovagina, weakness of the rectal wall, and urethral stenosis (blockage of the urethra resulting in inability to pass urine) {% cite bellringer:2007 --location 215 %}.

A very common but much less serious side effect is *granulation tissue* forming inside the neovagina, which is treated by treatment with silver nitrate. This can often be carried out by a GP or practice nurse.

The NHS will normally fund hair removal from the genitals before vaginoplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}). This is to ensure that hair does not grow in the vagina. The process of hair removal may take many months {% cite bellringer:2007 --location 217 %}. Not all patients require hair removal, and your surgeon should tell you whether you need to do this or not.
