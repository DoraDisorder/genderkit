{% capture warn %}
Metoidioplasty is a complex surgical procedure with signficant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Complications are common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulae (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update --location 732 %}.

An alternative to metoidioplasty is [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}), surgery to create a penis. Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metiodioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires only one surgery (compared to a series of surgeries for phalloplasty), less time in hopsital, and less scarring.

In a metoidioplasty, the clitoris is detached from the labia and the ligaments which hold the clitoris are cut. This causes the clitoris to move lower down.

At this point, urethroplasty (construction of an extension of the urethra) is often performed to allow urinating from the end of the clitoris. This is an optional procedure - you may not have this procedure and continue urinating from your existing urethral opening if you want.

The NHS will normally fund hair removal from the donor skin sites for urethroplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}).

In combination with metiodioplasty, many patients also choose to have [scrotoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) (surgical creation of a scrotum) performed in the same operation, which combined with using labial skin to wrap the clitoris can create small penis and scrotum.

Metoidioplasty first requires taking [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) which causes hypertrophy (enlargement) of the clitoris. Once this has occured (usually after 1-2 years into taking testosterone), metiodioplasty can be carried out {% cite frey2017update --location 732 %}. 

Sometimes the operation will be carried out during the same surgery as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), [vaginectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}), or [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). This can provide useful tissue for performing the urethroplasty.

Metoidioplasty, like other gender surgeries, will normally require two opinions from gender specialists (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery.

The cost of privately obtaining metoidioplasty in the UK is around Â£xxxx.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for metoidioplasty.
