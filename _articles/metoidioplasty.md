{% capture warn %}
Metoidioplasty is a complex surgical procedure with significant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Complications are common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulae (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}.

An alternative to metoidioplasty is [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}), surgery to create a penis. Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metiodioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires less surgeries, less time in hospital, and less scarring.

In a metoidioplasty, the clitoris is detached from the labia and the ligaments which hold the clitoris are cut. This causes the clitoris to move lower down.

At this point, urethroplasty (construction of an extension of the urethra) is often performed to allow urinating from the end of the clitoris. This is an optional procedure - you may not have this procedure and continue urinating from your existing urethral opening if you want, though this would require continuing to sit to urinate or using a stand to pee device. Avoiding a urethroplasty reduces the risk of complications {% cite cr181 -l 30 %}.

The NHS will normally fund hair removal from the donor skin sites for urethroplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}).

In combination with metiodioplasty, many patients also choose to have [scrotoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) (surgical creation of a scrotum) performed in the same operation, which combined with using labial skin to wrap the clitoris can create small penis and scrotum.

Metoidioplasty first requires taking [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) which causes hypertrophy (enlargement) of the clitoris. Once this has occurred (usually after 1-2 years into taking testosterone), metiodioplasty can be carried out {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}. 

Sometimes the operation will be carried out during the same surgery as [salpingo-oophorectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/salpingo-oophorectomy.md %}), [vaginectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginectomy.md %}), or [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). This can provide useful tissue for performing the urethroplasty.

### Cost and funding

A operation in the UK to perform metoidioplasty with urethral lengthening costs around £TODO.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for metoidioplasty or [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.
