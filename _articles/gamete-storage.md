A number of treatments and surgical procedures to change things related to gender may have infertility as a possible risk or a certain consequence.

Some people who wish to have children who share their genetic material will store gametes (sperm or eggs) that can later be used when they are ready to have children.

Gamete storage may involve:

- freezing sperm
- freezing unfertilised eggs
- freezing embryos

There is more information about sperm banking available on [the Cancer Research UK website](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/sex/men/sperm-banking).

There is more information about egg and embryo storage available on [the Cancer Research UK website](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/chemotherapy/fertility/women/ways-to-keep-fertility).
