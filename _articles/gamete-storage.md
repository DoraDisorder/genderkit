Storing gametes does not guarantee the ability to later have children. Use of stored gametes only sometimes results in pregnancy.

A number of treatments and surgical procedures to change things related to gender may have infertility as a possible risk or a certain consequence.

Some people who intend to have children after their treatment will store gametes (sperm or eggs) before they start treatment. These can later be used when they are ready to have children. The gametes are frozen and can be later defrosted and used at a time when they are needed.

Instead of storing gametes, it is also possible to store embryos or reproductive tissue. The techniques for using reproductive tissue are currently experimental {% cite deroo2017 -l 137 %}.

Alternatives to using stored material are adopting or fostering children, using donated sperm or eggs from another person, or using a surrogate. 

There is detailed information about gamete storage and fertility treatments for trans and non-binary people on [the Human Fertilisations and Embryology Authority website](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/fertility-preservation/information-for-trans-and-non-binary-people-seeking-fertility-treatment/).

### Costs and funding

Gamete storage for transgender people is not routinely available on the NHS.

The Human Fertilisations and Embryology Authority have details of [costs and funding of gamete collection and storage](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/treatments/explore-all-treatments/costs-and-funding/), including options that may help you reduce costs such as egg sharing and treatment abroad. You also can use [their search tool](https://www.hfea.gov.uk/choose-a-clinic/clinic-search/) to find a clinic that will help you.
