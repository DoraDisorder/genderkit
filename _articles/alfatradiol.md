There are only a small number of studies of the effects of alfatradiol on hair loss, and there is no clear conclusion on whether it is effective {% cite varothai2014androgenetic -l 221 %}.

In the UK, the more proven options of [minoxidil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/minoxidil.md %}) and [finasteride]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/finasteride.md %}) are used instead.

Alfatradiol treatment is not funded by the NHS.
