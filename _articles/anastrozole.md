### Why might I want anastrozole?
Taking anastrozole can reduce the amount of oestrogen in your body.
Anastrozole is normally used in breast cancer patients to slow the growth of
some tumours, but it can also be used to reduce breast growth {% cite

### Why might I not want anastrozole?
As anastrozole can have a number of side effects, in the UK [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) are usually used to stop the production of oestrogen instead.

### How does it work?

The human body naturally converts excess testosterone into oestrogen. Anastrozole works by stopping "aromatase", a chemical that the body uses as part of this process.
