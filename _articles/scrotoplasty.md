### More information

In scrotoplasty surgery, a scrotum is created. This is performed by reshaping and closing the labia majora together and then inserting testicular prostheses into the labia {% cite frey2017update -l 734 %}.

Often scrotoplasty will be performed during the same operation as [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}) or during the process of [phalloplasty]({% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}).
