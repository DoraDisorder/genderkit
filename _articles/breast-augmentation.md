The most common method of breast augmentation is using implants, though some alternatives exist including fat transplantation from another part of the body {% cite largo2014efficacy %}.

Alternatives for increasing breast size that do not need surgery include [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) therapy, [bra inserts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/bra-inserts.md %}), and weight gain.

There a number of different ways of performing breast augmentation using implants, with different advantages and disadvantages, some of which may be appropriate for you. You should research the differences in:

- *surgical approach*: inframammary, periareolar, transaxillary, or umbilical incision
- *implant position*: submuscular or subglandular
- *implant composition*: saline or silicone gel
- *implant shells*: smooth or textured surface 
- *implant shape*: round or anatomical (teardop) 

There is detailed information on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/breast-enlargement.aspx) which can help you understand these choices.

Common side effects of breast augmentation are capsular contraction (the body forming a tough shell around the implant which shrinks, often causing pain or change in shape of the breast), infections, and loss of sensitivity in the nipple area {% cite palma2016quality %}.

To ensure you are recieving the safest possible treatment, you should follow [advice from the Care Quality Commission](http://www.cqc.org.uk/help-advice/help-choosing-care-services/choosing-cosmetic-surgery) on how to choose cosmetic surgery.

There is a significant risk of complications that require additional surgeries. One study has reported that 30% of patients need a revision within six years and 7% require another revision within a year after that {% cite forster2013reoperation %}. Some surgeons may recommend that implants are replaced every 10-15 years for safety even if complications have not occurred {% cite davies:2007 %}.

It is possible to apply for funding for augmentation through exceptional funding processes within the NHS, but breast augmentation is not normally funded by the NHS, regardless of whether a diagnosis of gender dysphoria has been given.

In the event that you believe you have a special reason why an exception to the funding rules work should be made in your case, the following documents give information about to apply for this:

- *England:* [Interim Commissioning Policy: Individual funding requests](https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/08/cp-03.pdf)
- *Scotland:* [Adult Exceptional Aesthetic Referral Protocol](http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2011_27.pdf)
- *Wales:* [Individual Patient Funding Requests: Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/863/page/55331)
- *Northern Ireland:* [HSCB ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF REQUESTS FOR CARE AND /OR TREATMENT ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS](http://www.hscbusiness.hscni.net/pdf/Protocol_ECR_and__IFR_arrangements.pdf)
