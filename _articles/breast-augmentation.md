The most common method of breast augmentation is using implants, though some alternatives exist including fat transplantation from another part of the body {% cite largo2014efficacy %}.

There a number of different ways of performing breast augmentation using implants, with different advantages and disadvantages, some of which may be appropriate for you. You should research the differences in:

- *surgical approach*: inframammary, periareolar, transaxillary, or umbilical incision
- *implant position*: submuscular or subglandular
- *implant composition*: saline or silicone gel
- *implant shells*: smooth or textured surface 
- *implant shape*: round or anatomical (teardop) 

There is detailed information on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/cosmetic-treatments-guide/Pages/breast-enlargement.aspx) which can help you understand these choices.

Common side effects of breast augmentation are capsular contraction (the body forming a tough shell around the implant which shrinks, often causing pain or change in shape of the breast), infections, and loss of sensitivity in the nipple area {% cite palma2016quality %}.

There is a significant risk of complications that require additional surgeries. One study has reported that 30% of patients need a revision within six years and 7% require another revision within a year after that {% cite forster2013reoperation %}. Some surgeons may recommend that implants are replaced every 10-15 years for safety even if complications have not occurred {% cite davies:2007 %}.

It is possible to apply for funding for augmentation through exceptional funding processes within the NHS, but breast augmentation is not routinely funded by the NHS, regardless of whether a diagnosis of gender dysphoria has been given.
