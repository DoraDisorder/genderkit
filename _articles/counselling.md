It is a normal thing to need help from counselling at some points in your life. It is one of the most effective ways of dealing with mental health problems.

One in six people in the UK are experiencing a common mental health problem right now, and nearly half (43.4%) of all adults say they have experienced one {% cite apms2014 %}.

It is common for people who experience gender dysphoria to also have other conditions that involve mental health, particularly depression, anxiety, social anxiety, addiction, eating disorders and stress {% cite sta2012  de2011psychiatric %}. A large number of people with gender dysphoria (perhaps up to 20%) also have an autism spectrum condition {% cite van2016gender %}, and for these people dealing with these problems can be more complex.

If you think you have a mental health condition, you can speak to your GP who will be able to help you. They will often suggest that you try some kind of counselling, sometimes in combination with other techniques like medication or specialist assessments and treatments.

Counselling techniques are talking therapies: by discussing your problems in a safe environment with a counsellor you can gain a deeper insight into them. Counsellors do not "treat" or "heal" people like a doctor, nor do they give you general life advice. The counsellor instead helps you understand yourself and your problems so that you can move forward.

The people who perform counselling techniques may be known by a number of different names, including "counsellors", "therapists", "psychotherapists", "clinical psychologists" and "psychiatric nurses", depending on exactly what training they have and what their job involves {% cite sanders2002counselling %}. We're using the word "counsellor" here for simplicity. 

Your counsellor will be bound by rules of confidentiality which mean that they need to keep information you tell them private unless there is a good reason not to do so (for example, if they are required to by law, or if they believe you are at risk of killing yourself). Counsellors also normally have their own counsellors called "supervisors" who support them with the emotional challenges of their work.

You can read more about counselling on [the NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Counselling/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Cost and funding

The NHS provides counselling free of charge. You can often refer yourself directly to local organisations that provide counselling for the NHS, though it can be helpful to talk to your GP first as they may be able to offer you more options. If you are a patient with the NHS gender services, they may also be able to provide you with specialist counselling.

As the counselling provided by the NHS is usually limited to a small number of sessions, if you have more complex problems you may wish to pay to see a counsellor privately. The organisation [Pink Therapy](http://pinktherapy.com/) specialises in training counsellors who work with gender and sexual diversity clients, and they offer a directory of counsellors on [their website](http://pinktherapy.com/en-us/findatherapist.aspx).

You may find that choosing a counsellor can be difficult because they all offer differing approaches to counselling. You can find information on what the different approaches are on [the UKCP website](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-psychotherapy/types/). They also offer [tips on choosing a therapist](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-psychotherapy/choosing-a-psychotherapist/).
