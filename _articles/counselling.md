It is a normal thing to want or need help from counselling at some points in your life. 

You may be experiencing distress or problems with your mental health due to not being sure who you are, what you want to change about yourself, or how other people will react to changes. Counselling can help you talk through these problems. Counselling is also useful if you are facing life changes and want support to stay well or talk through issues that may come up.

One in six people in the UK are experiencing a common mental health problem right now, and nearly half (43.4%) of all adults say they have experienced one {% cite apms2014 %}. It is particularly common for people who experience gender dysphoria to also have mental health conditions, with transgender health services reporting that up to 38% of people attending their service have at least one "psychiatric disorder" (mental illness) {% cite arcelus2017 -l 177 %}. 

The most commonly found problems are [depression](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/depression/Pages/Introduction.aspx) and [anxiety](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anxiety/Pages/Introduction.aspx) {% cite arcelus2017 -l 177 %}. This can range from mild depression or anxiety to major conditions with a severe effect on quality of life. Other studies of people with gender dysphoria have shown that people may also have problems with [social anxiety](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-anxiety/Pages/Social-anxiety.aspx), [addiction](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Addiction/Pages/addictionhome.aspx), and [eating disorders](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Eating-disorders/Pages/Introduction.aspx) {% cite sta2012 de2011psychiatric %}. Counselling is one of the most effective ways of dealing with problems like these.

A large number of people with gender dysphoria (perhaps up to 20%) also have an [autism spectrum condition](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autistic-spectrum-disorder/Pages/Introduction.aspx) {% cite van2016gender %}. If you are one of these people dealing with emotional problems on your own without help can be even more complex and difficult.

If you think you might need help, you can speak to your GP. They will often suggest that you try some kind of counselling, sometimes in combination with other appraches like medication or specialist assessments and treatments.

Counselling approaches are talking therapies: by discussing your problems in a safe environment with a counsellor you can gain a deeper insight into them. Counsellors do not "treat" or "heal" people like a doctor, nor do they give you general life advice. The counsellor instead helps you understand yourself and your problems so that you can move forward.

Practioners may be known by a number of different names, including "counsellors", "therapists", "psychotherapists", "clinical psychologists" and "psychiatric nurses", depending on exactly what training they have and what their job involves {% cite sanders2002counselling %}. We're using the word "counsellor" here for simplicity. There are a variety of ways of working. Different approaches work for different people and in different situations. 

Your counsellor will be bound by rules of confidentiality which mean that they need to keep information you tell them private unless there is a good reason not to do so (for example, if they are required to by law, or if they believe you are at risk of killing yourself). Counsellors also normally have their own counsellors called "supervisors" who support them with the emotional challenges of their work.

You can read more about counselling on [the NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Counselling/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Cost and funding

The NHS provides counselling free of charge. You can often refer yourself directly to local organisations that provide counselling for the NHS, though it can be helpful to talk to your GP first as they may be able to offer you more options. If you are a patient with the NHS gender services, they may also be able to provide you with specialist counselling.

As the counselling provided by the NHS is usually limited to a small number of sessions, if you have more complex problems you may wish to pay to see a counsellor privately.

There are online directories you can use to find a private counsellor:

- [British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy](http://www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/)
- [UK Council for Psychotherapy](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/find-a-therapist/)
- [Pink Therapy](http://pinktherapy.com/en-us/findatherapist.aspx)

When searching for a counsellor, you should check they have been accredited by a professional body. Professional bodies ensure that your counsellor is properly trained and follows their rules and ethical framework.

You may find that choosing a counsellor can be difficult because they all offer differing approaches to counselling. 

The [BACP](http://www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/what-is-therapy/types-of-therapy) and [UKCP](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-psychotherapy/types/) both have guides to the different approaches.

You can also find advice on finding a counsellor on the [UKCP](https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-psychotherapy/choosing-a-psychotherapist/) and [BACP](http://www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/what-is-therapy/finding-the-right-therapist) websites.
