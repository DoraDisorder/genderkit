You might want to hide, emphasise, or enhance certain parts of your body shape. Common areas that people will often focus on are their shoulders, chest, waist, hips, legs, or neck. A variety of techniques can be used to alter the appearance of these areas, particularly choice of fit of clothing, materials, layering, padding, and creative use of optical illusions.

### Fit of clothing

- Baggy or flared clothing can help hide where your body is narrower - e.g. A-line skirts
- Tight clothing - can help draw attention to parts of your body, reduce size compared to parts of body where clothes are looser, and may help you look taller
- Layers - can help obscure shape
- Thick or inflexible materials - e.g. a thick or well-padded coat - to help hide shape

### Enhancing things

- Padding - shoulders, hips, chest (see relevant article)
- Height - heels, hats, hair
- Corsets - link to corsets page

### Optical illusions

TODO: pictures needed here!

- Stripes - vertical or horizontal
- Breaking up shapes - vertically or horizontally
- Using colour or brightness to draw attention
- Using dark colours or black to avoid attention and make look visually less prominent
- Dazzle camouflage - use non-repeating patterns to hide shape
