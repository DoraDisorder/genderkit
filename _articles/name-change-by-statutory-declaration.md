The simplest and most commonly used way of changing name in the UK is a [name change by deed poll]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}).

An alternative to this is statutory declaration, which is a document witnessed by a solicitor. This is sometimes useful if you are unable to find two independent witness, which is required for a deed poll change of name.

Once you have changed your name, you will need to update your details with lots of different organisations. You can find out who you need to notify and how to do it on our page about [telling organisations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/telling-organisations.md %}).
