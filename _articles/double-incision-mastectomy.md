Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

In double incision mastectomy, the breast tissue is removed, and usually the nipples are made smaller and repositioned.

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the double incision mastectomy technique. However, some people may be able to undergo [peri-areolar mastectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/peri-areolar-mastectomy.md %}) instead, which can result in less visible scarring {% cite davies2:2007 -l 227 %}.

If [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) is being performed, it can be useful to do this at the same time as double incision mastectomy as skin from that operation can be used as donor skin in the phalloplasty {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}.

Double incision mastectomy carries a risk of loss of sensation in the nipples or loss of the nipples entirely. If a nipple is completely lost, some people use cosmetic tatooing to give the appearance that the nipple is still there.

Mastectomy usually requires an overnight stay in hospital {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}. Mastectomy is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend around 4-6 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer. You will also need to return for a follow up appointment to determine if any further surgery is required to improve the cosmetic appearance.

You can read more about mastectomy on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/mastectomy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

### Cost and funding

The cost of privately obtaining a mastectomy in the UK is around Â£TODO.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy. Mastectomy for reasons of gender dysphoria requires a written letter of recommendation from a specialist gender clinician (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery {% cite cr181 %}.
