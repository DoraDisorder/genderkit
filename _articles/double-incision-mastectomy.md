Not all breast tissue is removed in mastectomy, and it does not remove the risk of breast cancer.

In double incision mastectomy, the breast tissue is removed, and usually the nipples are made smaller and repositioned.

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the double incision mastectomy technique. However, some people may be able to undergo [peri-areolar mastectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/peri-areolar-mastectomy.md %}) instead, which can result in less visible scarring {% cite seal:2007 --location 227 %}.

Double incision mastectomy carries a risk of loss of sensation in the nipples or loss of the nipples entirely. If a nipple is completely lost, some people use cosmetic tatooing to give the appearance that the nipple is still there.

Mastectomy, like other gender surgeries, will normally require two opinions from gender specialists (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery.

The cost of privately obtaining a mastectomy in the UK is around Â£xxxx.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for a mastectomy.
