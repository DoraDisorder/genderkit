Changing things about your gender can bring up lots of questions and unexpected emotions. Often, it can be helpful to talk to other people and get their input.

### Information and support services in the UK

In the UK, there are several specialist services available to provide you with information and support. If these services cannot help you themselves, they may be able to point you to other people who can help.

[Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/contact-us/) provide phone, online chat, and email support for transgender youth aged up to 20 in the UK.

[Mindline Trans+](http://bristolmind.org.uk/help-and-counselling/mindline-transplus/) is a helpline for adults in the UK who identify as trans or non-binary, run by mental health charity Mind.

[Gendered Intelligence Support Line](http://genderedintelligence.co.uk/projects/supportline) support patients of the Nottingham Centre for Transgender Health and the Sheffield Porterbrook Clinic.

[Leeds Gender Outreach Workers](https://www.mesmac.co.uk/our-services/leeds/trans-non-binary-gender-outreach-workers) provide support to patients of the Leeds Gender Identity Service.

### Counselling 

If you need longer term support, you may find counselling to be useful. You can find out more about this on our [counselling page]({% link _articles/counselling.md %}).
