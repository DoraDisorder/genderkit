### How do I get a new driving license?

You can update the name, title, and photo on your driving license with a D1 form. You can't update your license online. You can get D1 forms at a post office or have DVLA [send one to you](https://www.gov.uk/dvlaforms). 

To update your name on your license you will need to send your [deed poll]({% link _articles/name-change-by-deed-poll.md %}) or [statutory declaration]({% link _articles/name-change-by-statutory-declaration.md %}). Photocopies are not accepted, so you must either send the original document or a [certified copy](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document).

You do not need a doctor's letter to change the gender of your driving license. UK driving licenses do not have a gender marker but gender is encoded in your driver number {%cite dvla2009drivernumbers}. You may want to write a covering letter stating your transition and asking for the gender to be changed. 


### Where can I learn more?

You can learn more about applying for and updating driving licenses on [the DVLA website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-driving-licence).
