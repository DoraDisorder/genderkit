Making significant changes to your wardrobe can be intimidating!

### Finding your size

- Bra sizing:
- Other clothes: look for the words "size guide" or "size chart" on the website of the retailer. Some stores now offer an online service where you describe existing clothes you own that fit well, and they recommend which sizes of their clothing will likely fit you well.
- Where to measure your waist and your hips
- Remember that if you are taking hormones (or planning exercise or dieting) your clothing size may change, and you may need to buy more clothes.

You can also get alterations made professionally: you can find an alterations specialist using a search engine, or find an alterations service at most stores that offer dry-cleaning services, such as [Johnsons](https://www.johnsoncleaners.com/services/alterations-repairs/) or [Timpson](https://www.timpson.co.uk/services/clothing-repairs-alterations).
