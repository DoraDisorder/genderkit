{% capture warn %}
Salpingo-oophorectomy results in permanent destruction of the ovaries and is irreversible. After oophorectomy you will be infertile and unable to have children unless you have previously carried out [gamete storage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (i.e. egg storage).

After salpingo-oophorectomy, you will need to take at least one sex hormone ([oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %})) in order to prevent medical problems like osteoporosis.

Salpingo-oophorectomy is often carried out as part of [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) surgery, which removes the uterus (womb).

### Costs and funding

The NHS will normally fund total salpingo-oophorectomy and total [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) for patients who are undergoing [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) therapy.

You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones) {% cite cr181 %}. 

Hysterectomy for other medical reasons is not subject to these requirements.
