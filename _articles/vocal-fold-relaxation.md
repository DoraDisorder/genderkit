Vocal fold relaxation is a new and uncommon surgical technique that has the ability to significantly lower the fundamental frequency (pitch) of the voice {% cite davies2015voice -l 147 %}.

There are currently only a few small-scale short-term medical studies into using this technique in humans {% cite remacle2010relaxation kocak2008window %}, and how safe and effective it is long-term remains unknown.

It is also possible to increase the mass of the vocal chords by injecting them with fat from other parts of the body. This approach normally requires periodic "top up" injections {% cite antoni2017 -l 329 %}.

Both techniques are current rarely used.
