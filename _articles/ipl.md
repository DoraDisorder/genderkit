Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is an alternative to [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}).

It uses a bright flash of light from a xenon flashbulb that produces many different wavelengths - rather than the single wavelength used by a laser.

Medical studies have yet to come to a clear conclusion about whether IPL is more or less effective than laser hair removal. Some studies have suggested that treatment with IPL is less effective {% cite klein2013photoepilation ormiga2014comparison %}, while others have found no difference {% gan2013laser szima2017comparison %}.

IPL is less suitable than laser hair removal for people with darker skin {% gan2013laser %}.
