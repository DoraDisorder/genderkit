Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy is an alternative to [laser hair removal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-removal.md %}).

It uses a bright flash of light from a xenon flashbulb that produces many different wavelengths - rather than the single wavelength used by a laser.

Some recent medical studies have suggested that treatment with IPL is less effective than standard laser hair removal {% cite klein2013photoepilation ormiga2014comparison %}.
