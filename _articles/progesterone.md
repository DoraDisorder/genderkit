There are two types of chemicals used in progesterone therapy:

- *Progesterone* (usually sold in micronised form)
- *Progestins* (synthetic chemicals that stimulate the body's progesterone receptors)

Progestins (in particular, medroxyprogesterone or norethisterone) can be used to supress menstruation {% cite seal:2007 -l 182 %}. More recently, [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) have also been used for this purpose. (TODO: work out whether to cite Seal 2015 here or something else?)

Sometimes when [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) is used to encourage breast growth, progesterone is also used, as some people have claimed that it affects breast size or shape. There is currently no clear evidence whether this is helpful {% cite wierckx2014clinical %}. Some endocrinologists have also suggested that use of progesterone may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer {% cite seal:2007 -l 174 %}.
