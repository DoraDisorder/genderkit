### How do I stay safe?

{% capture warn %}
Progesterone may increase your risk of breast cancer.

{% include warning warning=warn %}

Studies have suggested that progesterone may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer {% cite million2003breast seal:2007 -l 174 %}. Using micronised progesterone may result in a lower risk {% cite asi2016progesterone %} but this may not remove all risk {% cite stute2018progesterone %}.

### Why might you want to use progesterone?

For post-menopausal women with a uterus, progesterone is sometimes used as part of post-menopausal hormone therapy, and may reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.

Some clinicians have suggested that progesterone may have positive effects on breast development and libido as part of feminising hormone therapy {% cite prior2019progesterone %}.

### Why might you not want to use progesterone?

There is not currently any good quality evidence that progesterone has any positive effect on breast development {% cite wierckx2014clinical %}, and some authors have suggested that progesterone may in fact negatively effect breast growth {% cite randolph2018gender %}.

There is not currently good evidence that progesterone has a positive effect on libido. If you are unhappy with your sex drive and wish to increase it, low dose testosterone gel may help improve sex drive {% cite cocchetti2021management kronawitter2009effects %} and is sometimes recommended for this purpose by NHS endocrinologists {% cite tavistock2021shared %}.

Some people describe improvement to their mood while taking progesterone, while others describe strongly negative effects on mood.

The majority of gender clinics in the UK do not prescribe progesterone for use in feminising hormone therapy {% cite tavistock2021shared nrgds2021guidelines sheffieldprogesterone %}, and this treatment is currently experimental. Studies of its effects as part of feminising hormone therapy are [in progress](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04534881) but have not yet reported any results.

### What kinds are there?

The most common form of progesterone used in the UK is micronised progesterone pills. Other prescribed forms of progesterone are pessaries and gel. Depot injections are not normally available from UK pharmacies, but are sometimes purchased from outside of the UK.

### Where can I learn more?

There are a number of detailed articles written about progesterone by community members on the [Transfeminine Science website](https://transfemscience.org/articles/#progestogens).
