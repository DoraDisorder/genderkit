labiaplasty involves surgically constructing labia, normally out of tissue taken from the penis and/or scrotum. The penis and scrotum are completely destroyed in the process.

Normally [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) (surgical creation of a clitoris) is carried out as part of labiaplasty. Some people also undergo [vaginoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}) (surgical creation of a vagina). 

labiaplasty is a major surgery and has a significant recovery time. You should expect to spend around 10 weeks time recovering before you are ready to resume work or study. When you are discharged from hospital, your surgeon should provide you with a sick note to give to your employer.

### Cost and funding

A operation in the UK to perform [labiaplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/labiaplasty.md %}) and [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) costs around £11-12000.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for labiaplasty and [penectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/penectomy.md %}), [orchidectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/orchidectomy.md %}), [clitoroplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/clitoroplasty.md %}) and/or [vaginoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vaginoplasty.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.
