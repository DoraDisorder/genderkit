Phalloplasty is a complex surgical procedure with significant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Phalloplasty usually causes significant scarring due to skin grafting (usually on the lower arm). Complications are also common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulae (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update -l 732 %}.

Phalloplasty is surgery to create a penis, usually with the ability to urinate out of the end of it, and to make it erect. Often [scrotoplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) is performed at the same time.

An alternative option to phalloplasty is [metoidioplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metoidioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires less surgeries, less time in hospital, and less scarring. Phalloplasty patients will usually receive erectile prosthetics that allow the penis to become erect instead. This is usually inflated by a pump, often hidden inside one of the testicular prostheses which is squeezed to inflate the penis implants.

Phalloplasty requires reuse of skin from some other part of the body, most commonly the forearm. This skin is removed and used to create a tube that is reconnected to veins and nerves in the desired location. The arm then normally receives skin grafts to replace the removed skin, but there will be significant scarring on the arm {% cite frey2017update %}. 

For some people, phalloplasty can provide a significant improvement in mental health. There is overall agreement in medical studies that after gender confirming medical interventions, rates of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric symptoms reduce considerably {% cite arcelus2017 -l 181 %}. However, as with other major life changes, you may find that [counselling]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/counselling.md %}) before and after surgery may be helpful.

You can find more information about phalloplasty and metoidioplasty on the [St. Peter's Andrology Centre website](https://www.andrology.co.uk/phalloplasty).

### Cost and funding

A operation in the UK to perform phalloplasty costs around £TODO.

If you have a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will usually provide funding for phalloplasty or [metoidioplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). The NHS will normally also fund hair removal from the donor skin sites for phalloplasty, either by [laser hair reduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/laser-hair-reduction.md %}) or [electrolysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/electrolysis.md %}). You will normally need to meet the following conditions:

- persistent and well-documented gender dysphoria
- capacity to make fully informed decisions and to consent to treatment
- if significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well controlled
- two medical opinions, usually at least one from a gender clinic, that surgery is appropriate 
- 12 months’ continuous endocrine treatment as appropriate to the
patient’s goals (unless the patient has medical contraindications
or is otherwise unable to take hormones)
- at least 12 months’ living continuously in a gender role that is
congruent with the gender identity {% cite cr181 %}.
