Bra inserts are anatomically shaped soft (usually silicone) objects that are placed into a bra to provide the impression there is more breast tissue present. These may also result in a more visible cleavage.

An alternative to bra inserts is [prosthetic breasts]({% link _articles/prosthetic-breasts.md %}), which are similar but are stuck to the skin using an adhesive.

Inserts can be bought from high street shops which have a large lingerie section, including Marks and Spencer, John Lewis, and Debenhams. They can also be bought from online retailers including Amazon. If you're worried about receiving bra inserts at your home address, you could try having them delivered to a nearby [Amazon Locker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200966210). 

Some retailers also sell "pocketed bras": these are bras specifically designed for holding bra inserts, normally used after a mastectomy surgery (surgical removal of all or part of the breast). These pocketed bras can also be used to hold bra inserts for people who have not had a mastectomy.
