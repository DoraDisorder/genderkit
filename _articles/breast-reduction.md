Breast reduction removes part of the breast tissue in order to reduce the size of the breasts. For complete removal of the breasts, see [periareolar mastectomy]({% link _articles/periareolar-mastectomy.md %}) and [double incision mastectomy]({% link _articles/double-incision-mastectomy.md %}).

You can read more about breast reduction on the [NHS Choices website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cosmetic-procedures/breast-enlargement/).

### Preparing for a surgical procedure
