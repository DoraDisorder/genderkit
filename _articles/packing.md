Packing provides an easy way to make it look like you have a penis.

Multiple different kinds of packers are available, including:

- *DIY packers:* using home made packers such as rolled up socks, or condoms filled with hair gel or "gak".
- *packers with built in STP:* these packers are designed with a built in funnel and tube that allows you to urinate out of them while standing ("standing to pee").
- *prosthetic packers:* these attach to your body using surgical glue so that they stay in place even when underwear is removed. More expensive models may be highly realistic and airbrushed to give a natural variation in colour.
- *packers designed for use in penetrative sex:* packers which contain a bendable rod or which can be inflated.

You may also need something to hold the packer in place:

- *tight/sports underwear:* wearing tight underwear or multiple layers of underwear can often be enough to hold the packer in place. 
- *packer pouches:* also known as "cock socks", these are fabric pouches with velcro on one side that attach to the inside of your underwear.
- *packer harnesses/straps:* a strap that goes around your hips which attaches to the packer to hold it in place.
- *boxer harnesses:* boxer shorts with a built in ring that the packer fits through to hold it in place.
- *DIY options:* such as modifying an existing pair of underwear by stitching in a pocket.

Packers come in different sizes. Bear in mind that penises get bigger during arousal, so don't try and order a packer that has the length of an erect penis unless you want to look like you are in a permanent state of arousal.

If you are using a packer as part of sex, be aware that it may transfer sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. You may want to use a condom over the packer, or sterilise the packer between uses - but remember that only packers made from silicone can be sterilised.

UK retailers of packers and harnesses are [Lovehoney](https://www.lovehoney.co.uk) and [Uberkinky](http://www.uberkinky.co.uk), who both advertise options for "discreet packaging".

If you find that you are still unhappy when packing, there are more risky and permanent surgical options of [phalloplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/phalloplasty.md %}) or [metoidioplasty]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}).
