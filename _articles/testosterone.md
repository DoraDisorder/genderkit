{% capture warn %}
Testosterone use can cause serious health problems and where possible should be carried out under the supervision of trained medical staff carrying out regular blood tests.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone may cause infertility. You should consider whether you need to use [gamete storage]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (egg storage).
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone usually causes periods to stop, but does not remove the risk of pregnancy.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

In a small proportion of people mensturation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) {% cite ngicns-endocrine --location 5 %} or [progesterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 %} can be used to do this instead.

Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced.

Testosterone use can cause serious medical conditions including polycythaemia (too many red blood cells) and liver problems. For these reasons, regular blood tests are extremely important to prevent health problems. Testosterone also increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (stopping breathing during sleep) which can lead to heart problems or sudden death.

Testosterone may also cause acne. You can read more about acne and how to reduce it on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

Testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, which increases risk of cancer. In the UK, it is recommended that people taking testosterone long-term undergo [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) to remove this risk {% cite seal:2007 --location 184 %}.
