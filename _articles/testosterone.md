Testosterone use can cause serious health problems and where possible should be carried out under the supervision of trained medical staff carrying out regular blood tests.

Testosterone is commonly available as depot injections or as gels applied to the skin. Oral (pill) forms of testosterone are rarely used as blood testing is more complex, and patches (transdermal testosterone) are rarely used in the UK (partly because of the frequency of bad reactions to patches) {% cite cr181 -l 37 %}.

In a small proportion of people menstruation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %} or [progesterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 %} can be used to do this instead.

Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide testosterone to selected 16 and 17 year olds {% cite gids2016 %}.

Testosterone use can cause serious medical conditions including polycythaemia (too many red blood cells) and liver problems. For these reasons, regular blood tests are extremely important to prevent health problems. Testosterone also increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (stopping breathing during sleep) which can lead to heart problems or sudden death.

Testosterone may also cause acne. You can read more about acne and how to reduce it on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

Testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, which increases risk of cancer. In the UK, it is recommended that people taking testosterone long-term undergo [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) to remove this risk {% cite seal:2007 -l 184 %}, usually within a maximum of 4-5 years {% cite cr181 -l 31 %}. 

### Costs and funding

If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide testosterone therapy.

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. If your GP agrees, the cost of your medication is funded by the NHS. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.

For testosterone therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.

Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide testosterone to selected 16 and 17 year olds {% cite gids2016 %}.
