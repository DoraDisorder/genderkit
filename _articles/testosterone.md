{% capture warn %}
Testosterone use can cause serious medical conditions including polycythaemia (too many red blood cells which can increase stroke risk) and liver problems {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}. For these reasons, it is important to only use testosterone under medical supervision with regular blood testing.

Testosterone may cause infertility which may be permanent. You should consider whether you need to use [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (egg storage).
{% endcapture %}

{% capture warn %}
Some brands of testosterone contain peanut oil. Take care to read the ingredients in your medicine if you are allergic to peanuts.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone usually causes periods to stop, but does not remove the risk of pregnancy {% cite fsrh2017contraceptive %}. Do not use testosterone as a method of contraception {% cite deroo2017 -l 136 %}.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Testosterone does not remove the need for [cervical screening tests](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cervical-screening-test/pages/introduction.aspx).
{% endcapture %}

Testosterone increases the risk of [obstructive sleep apnoea](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Sleep-apnoea/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (stopping breathing during sleep) which can lead to heart problems or sudden death. 

Symptoms of sleep apnoea include:

- very loud snoring
- noisy and laboured breathing while you are asleep
- stopping breathing followed by gasping or snorting

If you experience any of these symptoms, or you feel constantly tired or fall asleep during the day, speak to your GP. If you normally sleep in a room with someone else, you may wish to tell them the symptoms of sleep apnoea as you will not be awake to observe them.

Testosterone is commonly available as depot injections or as gels applied to the skin {% cite seal2017 -l 241 %}. Oral (pill) forms of testosterone are rarely used as blood testing is more complex, and patches (transdermal testosterone) are rarely used in the UK (partly because of the frequency of bad reactions to patches) {% cite cr181 -l 37 %}.

In a small proportion of people menstruation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) {% cite ngicns-endocrine -l 5 %} or [progesterone]({% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) {% cite seal:2007 %} can be used to do this instead.

Testosterone has noticeable effects on mood and thinking, and can increase energy and aggression, but can also help some people feel "more settled" in their body {% cite seal2017 -l 239 %}.

Testosterone may also cause acne. You can read more about acne and how to reduce it on the [NHS Choices website](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acne/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

In the UK, some clinicians recommend that people taking testosterone long-term should have a [hysterectomy]({% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}). They theorise that as testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which could lead to endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the lining of the womb), this might increase the risk of cancer {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}. However, subsequent studies have not shown any evidence of an increased risk of reproductive cancers from testosterone use, and they do not suggest any need for hysterectomy {% cite toze2018risky %}. Hysterectomy for people taking testosterone is optional and you may feel the risks involved in a major operation are unnecessary. If you decide not to undergo hysterectomy it has been suggested that scans to check for thickening of the endometrium every two years could reduce any potential risks {% cite seal2017 -l 240 %}.

For testosterone therapy to begin, it is required that any other significant medical or mental health issues are "reasonably well controlled" {% cite cr181 -l 24 %}. This means that a medical professional is currently helping or has helped you manage the condition.


### Costs and funding

If you have received a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}), the NHS will normally provide testosterone therapy. Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s on the NHS, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced. Some services may additionally provide testosterone to selected 16 and 17 year old people {% cite gids2016 %}.

You do not have to pay the full cost of medication you are prescribed on the NHS. You are not asked to pay anything at all in [Northern Ireland]( https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/prescriptions), [Scotland](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs) and [Wales](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs). In England, people are asked to pay a small charge for each item on their prescriptions. There are ways you can reduce or avoid this cost, which you can read about on [the NHS website](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs).

If you are using private gender services, the service will normally ask your GP to write you NHS prescriptions. Your GP may or may not agree to do this - it is up to them. NHS England have published [guidance for GPs](https://gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GMC-advice-to-GPs-on-online-specialists.pdf) to help them make this decision, which you may wish to give to your GP. If your GP agrees to prescribe, the cost of your medication is the same as any other NHS prescription. If your GP does not, the private service can write you private prescriptions, which you will have to pay the full cost of.
