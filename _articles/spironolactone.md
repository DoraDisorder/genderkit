Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.

Spironolactone is a type of drug called an anti-androgen. These drugs reduce testosterone levels.

Spironolactone is a commonly used antiandrogen in the US. In the UK, endocrinologists usually prescribe [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) instead, as while spironolactone is much cheaper to obtain, it can often have serious side effects {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}. GnRH agonists are considered to have a very good side-effect profile {% cite seal2017 %}.

A study has suggested that taking spironolactone with [oestrogen]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) may reduce the breast development caused by oestrogen {% cite seal2012predictive %}, though this has not been confirmed by other researchers.

Spironolactone may cause erectile dysfunction. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
