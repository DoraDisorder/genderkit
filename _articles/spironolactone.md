### What should I be aware of?

{% include get-tested %}

{% capture warn %}
Spironolactone can cause renal failure (kidney damage), permanent liver damage, and hyperkalemia {% cite seal2017 -l 236 %}. It should be taken under medical supervision with regular blood testing.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Prolonged anti-androgen treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

{% capture warn %}
Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.
{% endcapture %}
{% include warning warning=warn %}

Spironolactone is a type of drug called an anti-androgen. These drugs reduce testosterone levels.

Spironolactone is a commonly used antiandrogen in the US. In the UK, endocrinologists usually prescribe [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) instead, as while spironolactone is much cheaper to obtain, it can often have serious side effects {% cite seal:2007 -l 170 %}. GnRH agonists are considered to have a very good side-effect profile {% cite seal2017 %}.

A study has suggested that taking spironolactone with [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) may reduce the breast development caused by oestrogen {% cite seal2012predictive %}, though this has not been confirmed by other researchers.

### What else might I want?

Spironolactone may cause erectile dysfunction. If this is not desired, it can be treated with [sildenafil]({% link _articles/sildenafil.md %}), [tadalafil]({% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) or [vardenafil]({% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).
