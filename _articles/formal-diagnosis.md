Getting a formal medical diagnosis may help you access treatment, especially surgery. It may also help you update some legal documents, and acquire a GRC. 

Before getting a diagnosis, it's worth considering carefully whether you need one. It can be tempting to look for a diagnosis as validation, but it can also be pathologising --- making you feel like your identity is a "disease" --- and may be unnecessary, depending on what your needs are. Remember that lacking a diagnosis does not make your identity as a trans person any less valid.

### Why you might want a diagnosis

1. *To access treatment*

   A diagnosis is usually required to receive gender-related surgeries, and may help you get:

   - Hormone treatment
   - NHS funding for hair removal
   - NHS funding for speech therapy

   You may be able to get your GP to prescribe hormones *without* getting a diagnosis: see "Getting by without a diagnosis" below for more details.

2. *To get a Gender Recognition Certificate, or update the gender on your passport*

   Applying for a GRC requires providing a medical report detailing treatments you've had. Updating the gender marker on your passport requires either a GRC or a letter from a medical professional.

   In both cases your GP may be willing to write a letter for you without a formal diagnosis.

### Getting a diagnosis

In the UK, diagnoses for trans people are normally made by specialists. The exact diagnosis given in the UK can vary, but common diagnoses include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

These are all broadly synonymous from a medical perspective, though you may prefer a diagnosis of "dysphoria" as it is less pathologising and does not imply a binary identity. Any of these diagnoses should be as good as any other for accessing treatment.

Your GP should be able to refer you to one of the NHS gender services who will be able to diagnose you. If they are unsure, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions), or the resources on our [Information for clinicians]({% link _resources/clinicians.md %}) page.

If you wish, you can pay to use private specialist gender services. You may find this is quicker than using the NHS services, but it may cost Â£200 per hour or more for your appointments.

You can find details of both the NHS and private gender services on our [Specialist UK gender clinics]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) page.
