### Why might I want a diagnosis?

You need a diagnosis to get:

{% include iconlist iconlist="diagnosis2" %}

Most people who want *hormone therapy* will get a diagnosis to make this simpler, though you can [access hormones without a diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

You can get a diagnosis from a NHS gender service or a private gender service. It is quicker to be diagnosed privately, but if you have an NHS diagnosis, you can get NHS funding for:

{% include iconlist iconlist="funding" %}

You don't need a diagnosis to be "really" trans, but you might want a diagnosis to convince you and other people what you're feeling is real.

### Why might I not want a diagnosis?

You can do these now without a diagnosis:

{% include iconlist iconlist="diagnosis1" %}

You don't need a diagnosis if you only want to do these things. Remember, not having a diagnosis doesn't make you any less valid.

Some people do not want to be diagnosed because they feel it is pathologising (that a diagnosis feels like being told your identity is a "disease"), because they don't agree with the way the medical system works, and just because they feel it is unnecessary to. 

### How do I get a diagnosis?

In the UK, diagnosis is normally made by a specialist GP, psychologist, or psychiatrist at a gender service. 

To get a diagnosis in the UK, you need to either self-refer to a gender service or be referred by your GP - read how to do this on our [Getting a Referral page]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}).

### What diagnosis will I be given?

The exact diagnosis given in the UK can vary, but common diagnoses include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

These are all broadly synonymous from a medical perspective, though you may prefer a diagnosis of "dysphoria" as it is less pathologising and does not imply a binary identity. Any of these diagnoses should be as good as any other for accessing treatment.
