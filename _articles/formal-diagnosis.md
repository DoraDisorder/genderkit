A diagnosis is usually required to receive:

- hormone treatments
- gender related surgeries
- NHS funding for hair removal
- NHS funding for speech therapy

The exact diagnosis given in the UK is currently under review, but common terms used when diagnosing patients include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

In the UK, diagnoses of these conditions are normally made by specialists. Your GP should be able to refer you to one of the NHS gender services who will be able to diagnose you. If they are unsure, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/buy something we have created a ---advice-based-on-gmc-guidance), or the resources on our [Information for clinicians]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _resources/clinicians.md %}) page.

If you wish, you can pay to use private specialist gender services. You may find this is quicker than using the NHS services, but it may cost Â£200 per hour or more for your appointments.

You can find details of both the NHS and private gender services on our [Specialist UK gender clinics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) page.
