Getting a formal medical diagnosis may help you access treatment, especially surgery. It may also help you update some legal documents, and acquire a GRC. 

Before getting a diagnosis, it's worth considering carefully whether you need one. It can be tempting to look for a diagnosis as validation, but it can also be pathologising --- making you feel like your identity is a "disease" --- and may be unnecessary, depending on what your needs are. Remember that lacking a diagnosis does not make your identity as a trans person any less valid.

### Why you might want a diagnosis

1. *To access treatment*

   A diagnosis is usually required to receive gender-related surgeries, and may help you get:

   - Hormone treatment
   - NHS funding for hair removal
   - NHS funding for speech therapy

   You may be able to get your GP to prescribe hormones *without* getting a diagnosis: see "Getting by without a diagnosis" below for more details.

2. *To get a Gender Recognition Certificate, or update the gender on your passport*

   Applying for a GRC requires providing a medical report detailing treatments you've had. Updating the gender marker on your passport requires either a GRC or a letter from a medical professional.

   In both cases your GP may be willing to write a letter for you without a formal diagnosis.

### Why you might *not* want a diagnosis

1. *You find it pathologising*

   A diagnosis is essentially a declaration that you have a disease or
disorder. You might not like the idea that your identity is a disease.

   The newer diagnosis of "gender dysphoria" is better for this, as the implied
disease is not trans identity itself but the discomfort that comes from the
mismatch between identity, body and how society treats you. However, this
diagnosis might still be too pathologising for you, and there is no guarantee
that your clinician would use this term rather than the older
"transsexualism" or "gender identity disorder".

2. *You want to avoid "gatekeeping"*

   "Gatekeeping" is when doctors decide whether trans people should have access
to treatment, rather than allowing them to decide for themselves. This practice
has a long history in UK gender clinics, especially NHS ones, though some
clinics are moving away from it in recent years.

   Fears of gatekeeping might make it harder for you to trust your doctor, or
make you worried that being totally honest might make it harder to get
treatment {% cite vincent2018transgender --locator 39 %}.

3. *You don't need any of the treatments that require it*

   If you don't want surgery or hormones, there might be no point in getting a
diagnosis. Furthermore, if you only need hormones, there might be a way to get
them without a diagnosis; see "Getting by without a diagnosis" below for more
details.

### Getting a diagnosis

In the UK, diagnoses for trans people are normally made by specialists. The exact diagnosis given in the UK can vary, but common diagnoses include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

These are all broadly synonymous from a medical perspective, though you may prefer a diagnosis of "dysphoria" as it is less pathologising and does not imply a binary identity. Any of these diagnoses should be as good as any other for accessing treatment.

Your GP should be able to refer you to one of the NHS gender services who will be able to diagnose you. If they are unsure, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the General Medical Council](https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/trans-healthcare#mental-health-and-bridging-prescriptions), or the resources on our [Information for clinicians]({% link _resources/clinicians.md %}) page.

If you wish, you can pay to use private specialist gender services. You may find this is quicker than using the NHS services, but it may cost £200 per hour or more for your appointments.

You can find details of both the NHS and private gender services on our [Specialist UK gender clinics]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) page.

### Getting by without a diagnosis
If you don't need medical treatments, and don't need the gender on your passport updated, you should be fine without a diagnosis. The Equality Act (2010) protects you from discrimination on the basis of "gender reassignment", which will still apply to you even if you only pursue non-medical aspects of transition such as clothes, cosmetics and pronouns. If you are presenting as your gender identity, you should not be excluded from any spaces or services that are specific to that gender, with some very limited exceptions.

Getting the gender on your passport updated will require a letter from a doctor stating that you intend to live in the new gender permanently. Your GP might be willing to write this for you without a formal diagnosis.

Under some circumstances, it might be possible to get your GP to prescribe hormones without a diagnosis; hormone treatments are well-documented, easy to monitor for safety and cost the NHS relatively little. However, it is very unlikely that you will be able to access surgery without a diagnosis, at least on the NHS.

Vincent {% cite vincent2018transgender --locator 148 %} lists the following circumstances when it could be appropriate for your GP to prescribe hormones without referring to a GIC, or before you've been seen by the GIC you've been referred to:

- When you've *already been seen* by a GIC

  If you've already been seen by a GIC, there's little point in sending you back to one for another diagnosis.
- When you've *changed GP practice, and your previous practice was prescribing*

  There are various health risks associated with stopping hormones, so if you've already been prescribed then your GP should continue prescribing without requiring an assessment. They may want to take a blood test, and this is usually a good idea.
- When you need a *bridging prescription* --- a temporary prescription while you wait to be seen by a specialist

  Waiting lists for NHS services are notoriously long, and you might be able to convince your GP that it's unreasonable to expect you to wait that long for hormones.
- When you're already *self-medicating*, as part of a harm-reduction strategy

  Unmonitored hormone therapy carries a number of risks. If you're already taking hormones you got from another source, your GP should strongly consider providing a bridging prescription and monitoring blood tests.

It's very likely that your GP will still want to refer you to a GIC even if they do prescribe.

When talking to your GP, the following references may be useful:

- The NHS England service specification {% cite specEngNonsurgical --locator 30 %} states:

  > Endocrine and other pharmacological interventions may be recommended by a registered medical practitioner in the specialist multi-disciplinary team where they are essential for the purpose of harm reduction, and where they are in the individual’s best interest for reducing gender dysphoria, when assisting the individual in achieving gender expression congruent with their identity and consistent with their treatment goals.

- The NGICNS Explanatory Notes to the Scottish gender protocol {% cite ngicnsExplanatoryNotes --locator 5 %} states:

> Some service users may already be on hormonal treatment prior to referral, either through previous prescription or self medication. It is appropriate to continue this treatment following engagement with the GIC whilst Assessment One is undertaken. Appropriate prescribing guidelines and monitoring requirements are detailed in Endocrine Management of Adult Transgender Service users (NGICNS) and all service users should be made aware of this guidance and prescribing and monitoring of treatment brought in line with this guidance.

Many GPs might be hesitant to prescribe hormones due to an unfamiliarity with the standard treatments for trans people. The Nottingham Centre for Transgender Health has published two informational guides for masculinising {% cite ncthMasc %} and feminising {% cite ncthFem %} hormone treatment, which may help your GP work out the right treatment to prescribe.
