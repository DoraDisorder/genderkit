A diagnosis is usually required to receive:

- hormone treatments
- hair removal
- gender related surgeries
- speech therapy

The exact diagnosis given in the UK is currently under review, but common terms used when diagnosing patients include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

In the UK, diagnoses of these conditions are normally made by specialists. Your GP should be able to refer you to one of the NHS gender services who will be able to diagnose you. If they are unsure, you can direct them to [the advice for GPs published by the Royal College of General Practitioners](http://www.rcgp.org.uk/policy/rcgp-policy-areas/~/media/Files/Policy/A-Z-policy/RCGPNI-Guidance-for-the-care-of-Trans-people-in-primary-care-2015-web.ashx).

If you wish, you can pay to use private specialist gender services. You may find this is quicker that using the NHS services, but it may cost Â£200 per hour or more for your appointments.

You can find details of both the NHS and private gender services on our [UK Organisations page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link organisations.md %}).
