### Why might I want a diagnosis?

You need a diagnosis to get:

Most people who want *hormone therapy* will get a diagnosis to make this simpler, though you can [access hormones without a diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

You can get a diagnosis from a NHS gender service or a private gender service. 

It is quicker to be diagnosed privately, but if you have an NHS diagnosis, you can get NHS funding for:

You might also want a diagnosis to feel validated or feel closure. It could be a powerful acknowledgement that what you've been feeling is, from a medical perspective, real. However, you should keep in mind that the lack of a diagnosis does not imply that you aren't "really" trans.

### Why might I not want a diagnosis?

You can do these now without a diagnosis:

You don't need a diagnosis if you only want to do these things. Remember, not having a diagnosis doesn't make you any less valid.

Some people do not want to be diagnosed because they feel it is pathologising (that a diagnosis feels like your identity is a "disease"), because they don't agree with the way the medical system works, and just because they feel it is unnecessary to. 

### How do I get a diagnosis?

In the UK, diagnosis is normally made by a specialist GP, psychologist, or psychiatrist at a gender service. 

You need to either self-refer to a service or be referred by your GP - read how to do this on our [Getting a Referral page]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}).

### What diagnosis will I be given?

The exact diagnosis given in the UK can vary, but common diagnoses include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

These are all broadly synonymous from a medical perspective, though you may prefer a diagnosis of "dysphoria" as it is less pathologising and does not imply a binary identity. Any of these diagnoses should be as good as any other for accessing treatment.

### How do I get by without a diagnosis?
If you don't need medical treatments or a GRC, and don't need the gender on your passport updated, you may be fine without a diagnosis. The Equality Act (2010) protects you from discrimination on the basis of "gender reassignment", which will still apply to you even if you only pursue non-medical aspects of transition such as clothes, cosmetics, and pronouns. If you are presenting as your gender identity, you should not be excluded from any spaces or services that are specific to that gender, with some very limited exceptions.

Getting the gender on your passport updated will require a letter from a doctor stating that you intend to live in the new gender permanently. Your GP might be willing to write this for you without a formal diagnosis.

Under some circumstances, your GP may be willing to prescribe hormones without a diagnosis; hormone treatments are well-documented, easy to monitor for safety and cost the NHS relatively little. However, it is very unlikely that you will be able to access surgery without a diagnosis. See [Accessing HRT without a diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}) for more information.
