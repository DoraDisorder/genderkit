### Why might I want a diagnosis?

A diagnosis is needed for:

In the UK, most people will get a diagnosis to access *hormone therapy*, though there are also ways to [access hormones without a diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

Both NHS and private gender services can give you a diagnosis. If you have been diagnosed by an NHS gender service, you can access funding for:

### Why might I not want a diagnosis?

You can do these now, without a formal diagnosis:

You don't need a diagnosis if you only want to do these things.

Before getting a diagnosis, it's worth considering carefully whether you need one. It can be tempting to look for a diagnosis as validation, but it can also be pathologising --- making you feel like your identity is a "disease" --- and may be unnecessary, depending on what your needs are. Remember that lacking a diagnosis does not make your identity as a trans person any less valid.

You might find that obtaining a diagnosis provides you with a sense of validation or closure. It could be a powerful acknowledgement that what you've been feeling is, from a medical perspective, real.

However, you should keep in mind that the lack of a diagnosis does not imply that you aren't "really" trans.

Some reasons you might not want a diagnosis are:

-  *You find it pathologising*

   A diagnosis is essentially a declaration that you have a disease or
disorder. You might not like the idea that your identity is a disease.

   The newer diagnosis of "gender dysphoria" is better for this, as the implied
disease is not trans identity itself but the discomfort that comes from the
mismatch between identity, body, and how society treats you. However, this
diagnosis might still be too pathologising for you, and there is no guarantee
that your clinician would use this term rather than the older
"transsexualism" or "gender identity disorder".

-  *You want to avoid "gatekeeping"*

   "Gatekeeping" is when doctors decide whether trans people should have access
to treatment, rather than allowing them to decide for themselves. This practice
has a long history in UK gender clinics, especially NHS ones, though some
clinics are moving away from it in recent years.

   Fears of gatekeeping might make it harder for you to trust your doctor, or
make you worried that being totally honest might make it harder to get
treatment {% cite vincent2018transgender --locator 39 %}.

-  *You don't need any of the treatments that require it*

   If you don't want surgery or hormones, there might be no point in getting a
diagnosis. Furthermore, if you only need hormones, there might be a way to [access
them without a diagnosis]({% link _resources/hrt-without-diagnosis.md %}).

### How do I get a diagnosis?

In the UK, diagnoses for trans people are normally made by specialists. 

Your GP should be able to refer you to one of the NHS gender services who will be able to diagnose you.  You can read about how to ask for a referral on our [Getting a Referral page]({% link _resources/referral-appointment.md %}).

Once you've been referred to a specialist service, you can see our [First Appointments page]({% link _resources/initial-appointment.md %}) for information about what to expect and how to prepare.

The exact diagnosis given in the UK can vary, but common diagnoses include:

- gender dysphoria
- transsexualism
- gender incongruence
- gender identity disorder

These are all broadly synonymous from a medical perspective, though you may prefer a diagnosis of "dysphoria" as it is less pathologising and does not imply a binary identity. Any of these diagnoses should be as good as any other for accessing treatment.

If you wish, you can pay to use private specialist gender services. You may find this is quicker than using the NHS services, but it may cost Â£200 per hour or more for your appointments.

You can find details of both the NHS and private gender services on our [Specialist UK gender clinics]({% link _resources/gender-services.md %}) page.

### How do I get by without a diagnosis?
If you don't need medical treatments or a GRC, and don't need the gender on your passport updated, you may be fine without a diagnosis. The Equality Act (2010) protects you from discrimination on the basis of "gender reassignment", which will still apply to you even if you only pursue non-medical aspects of transition such as clothes, cosmetics, and pronouns. If you are presenting as your gender identity, you should not be excluded from any spaces or services that are specific to that gender, with some very limited exceptions.

Getting the gender on your passport updated will require a letter from a doctor stating that you intend to live in the new gender permanently. Your GP might be willing to write this for you without a formal diagnosis.

Under some circumstances, your GP may be willing to prescribe hormones without a diagnosis; hormone treatments are well-documented, easy to monitor for safety and cost the NHS relatively little. However, it is very unlikely that you will be able to access surgery without a diagnosis.
