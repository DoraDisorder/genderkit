Plucking is a painful and slow method of hair removal best used for small numbers of hairs.

For larger areas, you can use an [epilator]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/epilation.md %}), which is a device with a set of tweezers that quickly plucks out many hairs for you. You can also use other methods of temporary hair removal such as [waxing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/waxing.md %}) or [shaving]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/shaving.md %}).
