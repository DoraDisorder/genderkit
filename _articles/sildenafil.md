Alternatives to sildenafil include [tadalafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/tadalafil.md %}) and [vardenafil]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/vardenafil.md %}).

While tadalafil does have a longer lasting action than sildenafil and vardenfil, there is no evidence that any of the treatments is more effective than the others {% cite hatzimouratidis2005comparative %}.

There is good medical evidence that all three treatments are safe {% cite porst2013sop %}, with the vast majority of side effects being minor (flushing, headaches, temporary back pain) and subsiding within a few weeks of treatment {% cite carson2005phosphodiesterase %}.
