We've created a checklist of places you might want to notify of a change of names, pronouns or title.

{% include checklist %}

For further advice on how to update your details:

- HMRC have published guidance on how to notify them of [a change of name](https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details) or [a change of gender](https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details/gender-change). HMRC will normally notify the DWP for you.
- See [getting a new passport]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/getting-a-new-passport.md %}) for information about how to update your details with HM Passport Office.
