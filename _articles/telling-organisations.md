### What should I be aware of?

If you are under 16, you may need to supply proof of parental consent.

### Who should I tell?

We've created a checklist of places you might want to notify of a change of names, pronouns or title.

{% include checklist checklist=telling-organisations %}

### How do I update my birth certificate?

You may wish to update your name or gender on your birth, marriage, or civil partnership certificates. 

If you were born in *England* or *Wales*, the only way to do this is through [obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}).

If you were born or adopted in *Scotland* or *Northern Ireland*, you may also be able to request a change of name (but *not* a change of gender) on a birth certificate by officially [registering your name change]({% link _articles/registering-a-name-change.md %}) with the National Records of Scotland or General Register Office for Northern Ireland. People in Scotland and Northern Ireland can still update both their gender and name by [obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}).

{% capture warn %}
If you update your name on your birth certificate without a GRC, your birth certificate will show both your old and new names.
