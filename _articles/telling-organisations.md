We've created a checklist of places you might want to notify of a change of names, pronouns or title.

### Birth certificates

You may wish to update your name or gender on your birth, marriage, or civil partnership certificates. 

If you were born in *England* or *Wales*, the only way to do this is through [obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}).

If you were born or adopted in *Scotland* or *Northern Ireland*, you may also be able to request a change of name (but *not* a change of gender) on a birth certificate by officially [registering your name change by deed poll]({% link _articles/registering-a-name-change.md %}). People in Scotland and Northern Ireland can still update both their gender and name by [obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC)]({% link _articles/obtaining-a-grc.md %}).
