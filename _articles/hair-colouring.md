{% capture warn %}
The chemicals involved in hair colouring may cause an allergic reaction. It is very important to always perform a patch test first by using the chemicals on a small area 48 hours before applying it to the rest of your hair. This is especially important if you have ever had a black henna tattoo, [as you may be at risk of death](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/hair-dye-allergy/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

Hair colouring can either be done at home or by a professional in a hair salon. 

Hair colour uses a lightening step called "developer" (usually hydrogen peroxide based), followed by one of a variety of dyes. Depending on the type of dye (in particular, the molecular weight), the dye penetrates the hair differing amounts. Dye that penetrates further will result in a longer lasting effect - from lasting a few washes to until the hair grows out.

The typical cost is around £1-10 for home colour and £25-75 for salon colour.
