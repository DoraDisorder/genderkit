### More information

{% capture warn %}
Stylists may not realise which ingredients are contained in some permanent straightening treatments and underestimate the danger to themselves and their clients {% cite weathersby2013brazilian %}. Always ensure you discuss with your stylist what treatments are being applied and what ingredients they contain.

Hair is made from keratin proteins. In curly hair, these keratin proteins are held into a curled shape by chemical bonds.

These bonds can be broken, straightening the hair. This is done by different types of chemicals known as chemical relaxers:

- *hydroxides*, which are strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide or guanidine hydroxide. This process of breaking chemical bonds is called *lanthionization* {% cite de2007relaxing %}. To prevent the strong alkali attacking the scalp, it is useful to apply Vaseline along the hair line and on the ears. You should also carefully rinse off the chemicals after use. These chemicals are not suitable for straightening bleached hair and dying hair after chemical straightening can be difficult without damaging the hair {% cite dias2015hair %}.

- *thioglycolates*, such as ammonium thioglycolate. These chemicals must be followed by treatment with a hot straightening iron and hydrogen peroxide solution. These chemicals are not suitable for straightening bleached hair and dying hair after chemical straightening can be difficult without damaging the hair {% cite dias2015hair %}.

- *aldehydes*, often called "keratin treatment" or "Brazilian treatment". Keratin treatments have often contained dangerous cancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde, even when labelled "formaldehyde free". They may also contain methylene glycol, also known as methanediol, a chemical which releases formaldehyde when heated {% cite miranda2014overview %}. Stylists may not realise which ingredients are contained in keratin treatments and underestimate the danger to themselves and their clients {% cite weathersby2013brazilian %}.

Repeated chemical straightening of hair carries a number of risks, including itching, burns and scars on the scalp, thinning and weakening of the hair shaft, discolouration and hair loss, and allergic reactions {% cite miranda2014overview %}.

While called permanent hair straightening, treatment needs to be reapplied around every 12 weeks {% cite dias2015hair %}.

### Are there other options?

An alternative to chemical straightening is to break the chemical bonds by [hair straightening]({% link _articles/hair-straightening.md %}) using heat. This approach only lasts until the hair becomes wet, so is much more of a temporary solution.
